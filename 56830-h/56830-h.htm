  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Very little has been written in the past dealing with the
subject of the standards, guidons, colours, etc., of the British
Army. Scattered amongst Regimental histories, biographies
of illustrious soldiers, and military periodicals, a fair amount
of information may be discovered, but it is, of necessity,
disjointed and difficult of viewing in proper perspective.
Many years ago, a capital book was written by the late
Mr. S. M. Milne, entitled “Standards and Colours of the
British Army.” Unfortunately, this work was published
privately and, accordingly, did not receive the full measure
of appreciation which it merited.</p>

<p class='c000'>Students of Army Flags should consult this book whenever
possible; also “Ranks and Badges of the Army and
Navy,” by Mr. O. L. Perry; and the articles which appeared
in <cite>The Regiment</cite> during the latter weeks of 1916. Messrs.
Gale &amp; Polden’s folders dealing with Army Flags are also
instructive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to
Mr. Milne, Mr. O. L. Perry, and the Editor of <cite>The Regiment</cite>.
He is also very grateful for the assistance extended to
him by Lieutenant J. Harold Watkins and Lieutenant
C. H. Hastings, Officers in charge of the Canadian War
Records.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ever since the time when the Romans went into battle,
inspired by the vexillum or labarum, military flags or
colours have commanded a respect bordering almost
on the sacred. Our own history is crowded with incidents
which go to prove this contention. Who is there, for
instance, who has not heard of the gallant deeds of
Melvill and Coghill, two heroes who lost their lives in
an endeavour to preserve the Queen’s colour after the
disastrous Zulu encounter at Isandlwana? Or let us
take the case of Lieutenant Anstruther, a youngster of
eighteen, in the Welsh Fusiliers. In defending the colour
he carried up the treacherous heights of the Alma, a
shot laid him low, and eager hands snatched up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>emblem without a moment’s hesitation lest it should
fall into the possession of the enemy. No one thought
of the danger which might overtake them whilst guarding
the cherished but conspicuous banner; all were resolved
to perish rather than it should be wrested from their
grasp. And, let it be said, five men won the Victoria
Cross that day at the Alma for their gallant defence of
the colours. At the battle of Albuhera, in 1811, a colour
of the 3rd Buffs was carried by Ensign Thomas. The
French attacked in great force, and, surrounding Thomas,
called upon him to give up the silken banner. Thomas’s
answer was discourteous, but to the point; a moment
later he lay dead, and the French bore away the flag
with triumph. To the credit of the Buffs, we must add
that the emblem was back in their possession before
nightfall. These are just a few cases in which men have
been ready, and even eager, to make the great sacrifice
rather than lose their colours. They could be readily
multiplied a hundredfold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately, we have now reached an age when valuable
lives can be no longer spent in defending military flags
against the onslaughts of enemy rivals, for, to-day,
there is a rule in our army regulations which forbids the
taking of colours into the field of action. Before setting
out to meet the foe, they are placed in safe keeping, and
the rites which attend this ceremony partake of the
utmost solemnity.</p>

<p class='c000'>If military flags, which comprise the standards, guidons
and drum banners of the cavalry, and also the colours of the
infantry, have been reverenced in war, they are equally respected
in peace time. They may never be sent from place
to place without a properly constituted escort, which “will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>pay them the customary honours,” and an army regulation
says that “standards, guidons, and colours when
uncased are, at all times, to be saluted with the highest
honours, viz., arms presented, trumpets or bugles sounding
the salute, drums beating a ruffle.” When new colours
are taken into service their reception is impressively
conducted, and the old ones are trooped before being
cased and taken to the rear.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>The following miscellaneous instructions are given in
the King’s Regulations with respect to military flags
in general:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Standards and guidons of cavalry will be carried by
squadron serjeant-majors. Colours of infantry will be
carried by two senior second-lieutenants, but on
the line of march all subaltern officers will carry
them in turn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Standards, guidons and colours are not to be altered
without the King’s special permission signified through
the Army Council.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The consecration of colours will be performed by
chaplains to the forces, acting chaplains, or officiating
clergymen in accordance with an authorised Form of
Prayer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The standard of cavalry, or the King’s colour of
battalions of infantry, is not to be carried by any guard
or trooped, except in the case of a guard mounted over
the King, the Queen, and Queen Mother, or any member
of the Royal Family, or over a Viceroy, and is only to be
used at guard mounting, or other ceremonials, when a
member of the Royal Family or a Viceroy is present,
and on occasions when the National Anthem is appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>to be played; at all other times it is to remain with the
regiment. The King’s colour will be lowered to the
King, the Queen, the Queen Mother, and members of the
Royal Family, the Crown, and Viceroys only.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Special regulations apply to the Brigade of Guards,
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“The colours of the brigade will be lowered to His
Majesty the King, Her Majesty the Queen, the Queen
Mother, members of the Royal Family, the Crown,
Foreign Crowned Heads, Presidents of Republican
States, and members of Foreign Royal Families.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The King’s colour is never to be carried by any
guard except that which mounts upon the person of His
Majesty the King, or Her Majesty the Queen, or the Queen
Mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The regimental colours will only be lowered to a
field marshal, who is not a member of the Royal Family,
when he is colonel of the regiment to which the colour
belongs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A battalion with uncased colours meeting the King’s
Life Guards or King’s Guard, will pass on with sloped
arms, paying the compliment ‘eyes right’ or ‘eyes left’
as required.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A battalion with cased colours or without colours,
or a detachment, guard, or relief, meeting the King’s
Life Guard or the King’s Guard with uncased standard
or colour, will be ordered to halt, turn in the required
direction, and present arms; but will pass on
with sloped arms, paying the compliment of ‘eyes
right’ or ‘eyes left’ as required, if the standard or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>colour of the King’s Life Guard or King’s Guard is
cased.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Two regulations which affect the whole of the Army
may well be given in conclusion:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Officers or soldiers passing troops with uncased
colours will salute the colours and the C.O. (if senior).</p>

<p class='c012'>“Officers, soldiers, and colours, passing a military
funeral, will salute the body.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>A HISTORY OF MILITARY COLOURS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the period 1633-1680, the first five infantry regiments,
as we know them to-day, were established, and this may
be taken as a convenient point from which to begin a
study of the standards and colours of our Army. Before
this time the military forces of England and Scotland
went into battle with a full array of waving emblems,
decorated with rampant lions, powdered leopards, spread
eagles, and other gaudily-painted devices, but these were
usually the symbols of the knights and patrons who raised
the forces. Such flags possessed much heraldic or archæological
interest, but few claims on the student of military
lore, and may be thus set aside with the reminder that,
if knowledge of them is required, it may be gained from
such sources as the roll of Karlaverok.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first real military flags of which we have definite
records were those used in the Civil Wars. The cavalry
possessed standards revealing all manner of decorative
symbols with mottoes telling of their leader’s faith in
God, their hatred for the enemy, and the trust which
they placed in Providence. The infantry forces bore
colours devised with more regularity of purpose. Each
colonel flew a plain white, red or other coloured flag;
lieutenant-colonels were known by a flag bearing a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>St. George’s Cross in the upper left-hand canton; whilst
other officers possessed flags similar to those of the
lieutenant-colonels but bearing one, two, three, or more
additional devices, according to rank, such devices being
lozenges, pile-wavys (i.e., tongues of flame), talbots, etc.,
usually placed close up to the head of the staff.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this period Scottish forces favoured flags bearing
a large St. Andrew’s Cross, in the upper triangle of which
a Roman numeral was placed to denote the owner’s
rank.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1661, under the date of February 13th, what was
probably the first royal warrant to control regimental
colours, was issued by the Earl of Sandwich, Master of
the Great Wardrobe. It ran:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our Will and pleasure is, and we do hereby require
you forthwith to cause to be made and provided, twelve
colours or ensigns for our <b>Regiment of Foot Guards</b>,
of white and red taffeta, of the usual largeness, with
stands, heads, and tassels, each of which to have such
distinctions of some of our Royal Badges, painted in
oil, as our trusty and well-beloved servant, Sir Edward
Walker, Knight, Garter Principal King-at-Arms, shall
direct.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This warrant is of much interest; it tells us that the
early standards were painted and not embroidered;
that they were made of white or red material—white
was a sign of superiority, whilst red pointed to extravagance,
as it was more costly than blue, yellow, etc.;
and it told us that the Guards were to display the Royal
badges, which they do to this day. (All these badges are
dealt with in a separate chapter.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>In later years, the small St. George’s Cross which, as
we said above, figured in the upper corner of the flag,
gained more prominence and filled the whole of the
fabric. This may be considered the second period in
the history of regimental colours. The reader will readily
see that this change in English flags was brought about
by contact with the Scottish regiments which had flown
for many years previously their colours bearing large
crosses of St. Andrew.</p>

<p class='c000'>An interesting flag of this period is that of the
<b>Coldstream Regiment</b> (date about 1680). A drawing
of it may be seen in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.
The groundwork of blue taffeta is quite plain for the
colonel. The lieutenant-colonel’s banner is blue, with a
large St. George’s Cross, edged with white; whilst the
major flew a similar banner, to which was added a white
pile-wavy issuing from the top left-hand corner. The
captains’ banners are like that of the major, but bear a
distinguishing Roman numeral to show seniority of rank.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>In piecing together the history of the early Army flags,
a certain Nathan Brooks has given us much valuable
assistance. He went to Putney Heath on October 1st,
1684, to see the King review the troops, and was wise
enough to write down a description of the colours which
figured in the function. Probably no better account of
the flags of this period is still available. Here it is:—<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The King’s Own Troop of Horse Guards and
Troop of Grenadiers.</b>—The standard, crimson with the
royal cypher and crown; the guidon, differenced only
from the standard by being rounded and slit at the ends.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“<b>The Queen’s Troop of His Majesty’s Horse
Guards and Troop of Grenadiers.</b>—The standard and
guidon as the King’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The Duke’s Troop of His Majesty’s Horse Guards
and Troop of Grenadiers.</b>—The standard and guidon
of yellow damask, with His Royal Highness’s cypher
and coronet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The Regiment of the Horse Guards</b> (now the
Royal Horse Guards, the Blues), eight troops.—The
standard of the King’s troop, crimson, with the imperial
crown, embroidered; the colonel’s colour flies the royal
cypher on crimson; the major’s, gold streams on crimson;
the first troop, the rose crowned; the second, a
thistle crowned; the third, the flower <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de luce</span>, crowned;
the fourth, the harp and crown; the fifth, the royal
oak; all embroidered upon the crimson colours.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The King’s Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons</b>,
commanded by John, Lord Churchill.—The colours to each
troop thus distinguished: the colonel’s, the royal cypher
and crown embroidered upon crimson; the lieutenant-colonel’s,
the rays of the sun, proper, crowned, issuing
out of a cloud, proper, and is a badge of the Black
Prince’s. The first troop has, for colours, the top of a
beacon, crowned or, with flames of fire proper, and is a
badge of Henry V. The second troop, two ostrich’s
feathers crowned argent, a badge of Henry VI. The
third, a rose and pomegranate impaled, leaves and stalk
vert, a badge of Henry VIII. Fourth troop, a phœnix
in flames, proper, a badge of Queen Elizabeth; each
embroidered upon crimson.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“<b>First Regiment of Foot Guards</b> (of twenty-four
companies).—The King’s company, standard all crimson,
cypher and crown embroidered in gold; the colonel’s
white with the red cross (St. George’s), the crown or: the
lieutenant-colonel’s, the same cross, with C.R. crowned
or: the major’s, C.R. and crown, with a blaze crimson
(i.e., a flame issuing from the top left-hand corner of
the flag); the first company, with the King’s crest, which
is a lion passant guardant crowned or, standing on a
crown. (Brooks then gives the remaining company
badges which are set out in full later.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>Colestream or Cauldstream Regiment of Foot
Guards.</b>—This regiment flyes the St. George’s Cross,
bordered with white in a blew field (cf. above).</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The Royal Regiment of Foot</b>, commanded by
the Earl of Dumbarton, flyes a St. Andrew’s Cross,
with a thistle and crown circumscribed in the centre,
‘Nemo me impune lacessit.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The Queen’s Regiment of Foot</b>, commanded by
the Hon. Piercy Kirk, flyes a red cross bordered with
white and rays as the admirals (see below), in a green
field, with Her Majesty’s royal cypher in the centre.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The Duke of Albany’s Maritime Regiment of
Foot.</b>—The Admiral flyes the red cross, with rays of the
sun issuing from each angle of the cross, or.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The Holland Regiment of Foot</b> (afterwards the
3rd Buffs) flyes the red cross bordered white in a green
field.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of York and
Albany’s Regiment of Foot</b> (4th King’s Own) flies a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>red cross in a yellow field, bordered white, with rays, as
that of the Admiral’s, with H.R.Highness’s cypher in
the centre.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having completed the quotation from Brooks, we
are able to give an extract from an old M.S., which is
interesting when read in conjunction with the above
descriptions of Army flags:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The imbroidered cypher and crowne on both sides
Ye King’s owne colours, £3 . 10 . 0.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For painting and guilding ye other 23 colours and
crownes on both sides one with another at 15s. a
side, £34 . 10 . 0.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clearly this extract refers to the First Regiment of
Foot Guards, and shows that the King’s colours were
embroidered, whilst the Company colours were merely
painted. Before this time, we know that most flags
were painted and, afterwards, that the tendency was
for them to be embroidered. It seems fair, then, to infer
from this that when the King reviewed his troops at
Putney Heath, the period was one of transition from
painted to embroidered decoration.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>Passing on to the reign of King James II., it seems
that he evolved many changes which were but little
appreciated in the military quarters in those days. An
authority of the time, named Sandford, who wrote a
book entitled, “A History of the Coronation,” describes
some of the Army flags as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>1st or King’s Guards.</b>—The standard of the
King’s Own Company was of crimson silk, embroidered
in the centre with the royal cypher, J.R., ensigned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>(i.e., having above it) an imperial crown in gold. The
colonel’s, also of crimson silk, was not charged with any
distinction or device. The lieutenant-colonel’s colour
was of white silk with the cross of St. George throughout
(i.e., covering the flag) of crimson silk, in the middle of
which was painted an imperial crown in gold. The
major’s colour was distinguished by a pile-wavy of crimson
silk issuing out of the dexter chief of the first quarter
(i.e., the corner of the flag nearest to the top of the staff),
and an imperial crown of gold in the centre of the cross.
The eldest captain’s colour was distinguished by one of
the King’s cyphers, viz., J.R., interlaced, and an imperial
crown painted in the middle of the cross, of gold; the
second captain was differenced by two royal cyphers
and crowns in the cross; the third, by three; the fourth,
by four; and so on every captain to the twentieth who
had his cross charged with twenty cyphers and crowns.
And thus they appeared at James’s coronation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>Coldstream Guards.</b>—His Majesty did then also
direct that the alterations following should be made in
the ensigns of this his second regiment of Foot Guards,
that they might be more agreeable to the colours of the
first regiment; for, excepting the colonel’s ensign,
which was purely of white taffeta, the other eleven were
charged with crosses of crimson taffeta throughout.
The lieutenant-colonel’s, without distinction. The
major’s had a pile-wavy. The cross of the eldest captain
was charged on the centre with the figure I. in white,
ensigned with an imperial crown of gold painted thereon;
the second with II., the third with III., the fourth, IV.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and so forward to the ninth captain who was distinguished
by IX., each of them under an imperial crown of gold.
And thus did these ensigns fly at the coronation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With the help of Sandford’s description, and a series
of coloured plates, which may be seen in the library at
Windsor, we are able to get a very correct impression
of the Army colours of this period. Generally speaking,
they were remarkable for their brilliant colouring, their
fanciful fabric, their lack of similarity one with another,
and their show of private as opposed to royal badges.
In this latter connection, the colours of James showed a
clear harking back to the pre-Reformation days. Our
first figure, on Plate I., reveals an attractive colour of
the period; it represents the standard of the Second
Troop of Horse Guards, date about 1687. The angels
which support the large central crown were taken from
a popular French device, whilst the three small crowns
placed near the lower edge, refer to the King’s claim to
the crowns of England, Ireland and France. The central
cypher, it may be well to point out, is not F.R. but J.R.
The second illustration reveals the Earl of Shrewsbury’s
rampant lion on a yellow field. There is a difference of
opinion as to whether the background should not be
lightish buff, but the Windsor plates certainly favour
the colour as given in Fig. 2. The flag is the colonel’s
standard of Shrewsbury’s Regiment of Horse (now the
<b>5th Dragoon Guards</b>).</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>We have hinted that this was an era of much decoration,
but to this rule there is one outstanding exception—we
refer to the <b>Scots Guards</b>. In this case, the
colonel’s colour was plain white, a favourite flag of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>earlier times. The lieutenant-colonel’s was the national
flag of Scotland, a white St. Andrew’s Cross on a blue
field. The major’s was the same, but with a pile-wavy
issuing from the upper corner of the cross, and the captain’s
as the lieutenant-colonel’s, but with a silver numeral
placed on the uppermost blue triangle. All were provided
with silver and blue tassels, and a silver spear surmounted
the pole, emblems which served to distinguish the flags
of the Scots Guards from the national flags which were
current at that time.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>From the end of the reign of James II. to 1707, when
England and Scotland formed a legislative union, we
can trace but little in the progress of military colours.
The Union, however, came and left a very clear impress
on the banners of the time. Wherever the red cross of
St. George had been used, it was modified with the white
cross of St. Andrew, together with its distinctive blue
triangular fields. As a rule, the authorities favoured
the use of small crosses, placed in the upper canton,
rather than large ones covering the whole fabric, for this
enabled a fairly big portion of the flag to be used for
displaying the arms of each particular military unit.
A typical example of this period is shown in Fig. 5.
Here we have the colonel’s colour of General Grove’s
Regiment, afterwards the 10th Foot (now the <b>Lincolnshire
Regiment</b>). The talbot, the motto, and the ermine
representations were all features in the crest borne by
General Grove. The date of this flag is 1726. Fig. 6,
which shows the colours of the 27th or <b>Inniskilling
Regiment</b>, is also typical. Its date may be put down at
about 1747.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The union did not appear on the infantry colours
alone, during this period; it also figured, but to a lesser
extent, in the cavalry standards, as may be noted from
the following interesting quotation from Milne.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Very little is known about cavalry standards from the
time of James II. until the middle of the next century;
no drawings or evidence of any kind seem forthcoming.
One solitary specimen has been preserved, however, and
that of great interest, namely, the Dettingen standard
of the old 8th, subsequently 4th Horse (afterwards <b>7th
Dragoon Guards</b>).</p>

<p class='c000'>“A record of this regiment gives a very full and
detailed account of its bravery at Dettingen, under the
command of its well-known colonel, Major-General John
Ligonier, who was created a knight-banneret on the
field of battle by the King (George II.) in person, and
further proceeds to relate that Cornet Richardson,
carrying a standard, was surrounded by the enemy and,
refusing to surrender, received upwards of thirty sabre
cuts in his body and through his clothes. His standard
and standard lance were also damaged but he brought his
precious charge out of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>“During the winter the standards, so much damaged
in the battle as to be unfit for use, were replaced by
new ones from England, and each cornet was presented
with the one he had carried, as a testimony to his good
conduct. That presented to Cornet Richardson is still
carefully preserved by his descendant and representative.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is made of crimson silk brocade, about twenty-four
inches square, edged with gold and silver fringe, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>small union, three inches square, in the upper corner;
one side, the obverse, presents the crest and motto of the
colonel, General Ligonier (a demi lion issuing out of a
ducal coronet) with his motto, “Quo fata vocant,” on
a scroll above; the reverse gives his full coat of arms,
crest, shield and motto, surrounded with a handsome
trophy of standards, trumpets, and implements of war,
all finely worked in gold embroidery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The feature of providing each side of the standard
with a different pattern, mentioned above, was unusual.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far we have seen that with but one or two exceptions,
no restrictions were put upon the regimental authorities
in designing their own colours. Each unit was free
to select its devices at will, and choose whatever colouring
seemed to fit its banners most. In 1743, however, a
Royal Warrant was issued which checked this freedom
of design. It ran:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Union colour is the first stand of colours in all
regiments, royal or not, except the Foot Guards. With
them the King’s Standard is the first as a particular
distinction.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No colonel to put his arms, crest, device, or livery
in any part of the appointments of his regiment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The first colour of every marching regiment of foot
is to be the great Union; the second colour is to be the
colour of the facing of the regiment, with the Union in
the upper canton; except those regiments faced with
white or red, whose second colour is to be the Red Cross
of St. George, in a white field and a Union in the upper
canton. In the centre of each colour is to be painted, in
gold Roman figures, the number of the rank of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>regiments, within a wreath of roses and thistles on one
stalk, except those regiments which are allowed to wear
royal devices or antient badges; the number of their rank
is to be painted towards the upper corner. The length
of the pike and colours to be the same size as those of
the Foot Guards; the cord and tassels of all colours to
be crimson and gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the Royal Regiments, the Fusilier and the Marine
Regiments, the Old Buffs, the 5th and 6th Regiments,
the 8th or King’s Regiment, and the 27th or Inniskilling
Regiment are distinguished by particular devices, and
therefore, not subject to the preceding articles for
colours.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Standards and Guidons of the <b>Dragoon Guards</b>,
and the Standards of the <b>Regimental Horse</b>, to be of
Damask, embroidered and fringed with Gold or Silver.
The Guidons of the Regiments of Dragoons to be of
Silk. The Tassels and Cords of the whole to be of Crimson
Silk and Gold mixed. The size of the Guidons and Standards,
and the length of the Lance to be the same as
those of the Horse and Horse Grenadier Guards.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The King’s or first Standard and Guidon of each
Regiment to be Crimson, with the Rose and Thistle,
conjoined, and Crown over them, in the Centre: His
Majesty’s Motto, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu et mon Droit</span>,’ underneath. The
White Horse in a Compartment in the first and fourth
corners; and the Rank of the Regiment in Gold or
Silver Characters on a Ground of the same Colour as the
Facing of the Regiment in a Compartment in the second
and third Corners.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The second and third Standard and Guidon of each
Corps to be of the Colour of the Facing of the Regiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>with the Badge of the Regiment in the centre, or the
Rank of the Regiment in Gold or Silver Roman characters,
on a crimson ground, within a Wreath of Roses
and Thistles on the same stalk, the Motto of the Regiment
underneath. The White Horse, on a red ground to be
in the first and fourth Compartments; and the Rose and
Thistle conjoined upon a red Ground in the second and
third Compartments. The distinction of the third Standard
or Guidon to be a figure 3 on a circular ground of
Red underneath the Motto. Those Corps which have
any particular badge are to carry it in the centre of their
second and third Standard or Guidon, with the Rank of
the Regiment on a red ground within a small Wreath of
Roses and Thistles in the second and third corner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This warrant is remarkable from the fact that it swept
aside many customs which had taken years, even centuries
in some cases, to mature, and instituted new ones
which, with slight modifications, have remained till
to-day. The details set out for the Dragoon Guards are
particularly elaborate, so much so that few people seem
to know just what to make of them. Milne says that the
Dragoon regulations did not come into use very rapidly
because they were not understood. To support this
contention, he quotes the following Annual Inspection
Returns. “<b>1st Dragoon Guards.</b> Shrewsbury,
November 5th, 1750. The inspecting officer reports
Standards received in 1740, and in bad condition, the
regiment waiting for a pattern from His Royal Highness
the Duke.” Again, <b>6th Dragoons</b>. Ipswich, November
22nd, 1750: “Waiting for a pattern from His Royal
Highness the Duke.” Evidently, says Milne, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>found difficult to work from the printed details, and
there appears to have been delay in settling the precise
form the numerous badges should take until the commander-in-chief
had sanctioned a pattern standard.
When the patterns were decided upon they were practically
identical to those in use to-day, and far more
elaborate than those they displaced, as a reference to
Figs. 3 and 4 will show. In these figures, two forms of
the standard of the 2nd Dragoon Guards of 1742 are
given.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 1743 warrant gave rise to much uncertainty, even
outside the section which referred to the Dragoon Guards,
and, consequently, it is not surprising to find that many
official orders and “letters” were issued giving advice
and information telling how the various regulations
were to be carried out. One such document determined
the measurements of the Army Union flag, which were,
of course, not those of the national Union flag. The
horizontal edge was given as 6 ft. 6 ins., the vertical edge,
6 ft. 2 ins.; the width of the St. George’s Cross,
1 ft. 1 in.; the width of the white edging to the St.
George’s Cross, 5 ins.; the width of the St. Andrew’s
Cross, 9 ins. (The diagonal red cross of St. Patrick did
not then form part of the Union). Also, the length of
the pike was 9 ft. 10 ins.; the length of the cords with
tassels, 3 ft.; each tassel was 4 ins.; and the length of
the spear-head of the pike, 4 ins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The idea of controlling the regimental colours by the
higher authorities seems to have found favour and, as
a result, further regulations were issued in a supplementary
warrant in 1747.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Colonel Napier, who was responsible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>for this document, decided upon the following particulars:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the period beginning with the year 1751, Milne
writes as follows:<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> “An entirely new era is now being
entered upon; a complete break has taken place in the
continuity of the colours of the British infantry; the
colonel’s and lieutenant-colonel’s flags have disappeared<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>,
together with their gaudy and ever varying private
armorial devices, distinctive perhaps to the educated,
but to the unlettered rank and file emblematical of but
little.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In their place, boldly and resolutely stands the regimental
number, simple in form, easily recognised, easily
remembered, forming a rallying point in the minds of
soldiers, which, as decade after decade passed away,
became indissolubly connected with some glorious deed,
in its turn becoming a matter of history, adding lustre
to the regimental number, and so, gradually, but surely,
building up that wonderful <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> which has stood
the nation in good stead on so many occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Extremely plain at first, only the number within its
flowery surroundings, the flowers will be observed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>become more ornate; tokens of honour, the remembrance
of some gallant action or campaign, added from time to
time, and ultimately the names of victories duly and
discreetly authorised to be emblazoned: and all
surrounding and centreing upon the old regimental
number, ever enhancing its value in the eyes of those who
had the honour of serving under it.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>The American War of Independence, as the reader
may justly suppose, marks another period in the history
of military flags. In those days it was customary, though
not the immutable rule, to carry these emblems into the
line of battle, and as this period of fighting brought us
many reverses the effect on the colours was often disastrous.
Many were taken by the enemy, many more
were worn to shreds, and a few were hidden and lost.
It is forgotten by some of us that American raiders
infested our shores and sank numbers of British vessels.
The toll of ships led, at times, to the loss of colours.
Here is a case in point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Report of an Inspection of the 81st Aberdeenshire
Highlanders, at Kinsale. “Colours wanting; were
taken on passage from England to Ireland by an American
privateer. A new stand making in Dublin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As a result of all these happenings, many regiments
will be found to have had new colours at some time
during the period 1776-83.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>Continuing our history, we find that the next step to
note concerns the placing of battle honours on military
flags. The first of these distinctions was “Emsdorf,”
and was given to the 15th Light Dragoons in 1768. Ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>years later, the second distinction, “Gibraltar,” was
awarded to a quartette of regiments. It was the King’s
appreciation of the forces which withstood the fierce
siege with “red-hot potatoes” under the command of
General Eliot, afterwards Lord Heathfield. The official
intimation of this grant is worth quoting <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“April 28th, 1784. I seize the opportunity to acquaint
you further that His Majesty has been graciously pleased
in commemoration of the glorious defence made by those
regiments which comprised the garrison of Gibraltar
during the late memorable siege of that important
fortress to permit the 12th, 39th, 56th, 58th Regiments
which made a part of it, to have the word ‘Gibraltar’
placed upon their grenadier and light infantry caps,
their accoutrements and drums, as likewise upon the
second colour of each of those regiments, just underneath
their respective numbers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“William Fawcett, Adjt.-General.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It will be noticed that the distinction was to be fixed
to the second or regimental colour, and not to that of
the King’s—a rule which holds till this day, with but a
few exceptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Act of Union, which linked together the parliaments
of England and Ireland in 1801, had a considerable but
obvious influence on the objects of this study. Hardly
was there a flag in the whole of the Army which did not
become obsolete by this union. Many of them were
retired, and fresh ones provided, but the general plan
was to modify the existing specimens. This was done
by sewing red strips along the white limbs of the St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Andrew’s Cross to provide for the St. Patrick’s Cross,
and by adding shamrocks to the wreath of leaves and
flowers which encircled the regimental badge. Milne says
that the intrusion of the shamrock was in all cases manifest,
so that examples of this date may be recognised
with ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is worth mentioning that colours are often modified
or altered to keep abreast with changing circumstances;
new ones are not always provided the moment they
become obsolete in one or more small particulars. The
same writer from whom we just quoted describes the
changes which the standard of the <b>Coldstream Guards</b>
underwent during a period of some sixteen years. “When
originally made, ... the central garter star (i.e., the
regimental badge) and the wreath richly embroidered
in gold bullion, but without the shamrock, and possibly
the crown, were all that appeared on the plain crimson
silk ground. The union with Ireland, 1801, necessitated
the introduction of the shamrocks ... they have been
squeezed into places when scarcely room could be found
for them. ‘Egypt’ and the ‘Sphinx’ having been
authorised, they would probably be added at the same
time, ‘Egypt’ on a blue silk label, immediately under
the wreath, the ‘Sphinx’ within a laurel wreath of
gold embroidery, in all the four corners. The standard
continued in this state until 1814, when the honours,
‘Lincelles, Talavera, Barrosa,’ were authorised to be
used by the regiment. Consequently, they were added
in gold twist letters, on the crimson ground. Two
more honours, ‘Peninsula and Waterloo,’ were further
authorised in 1815-16, and added soon after on
crimson silk (some trouble must have been occasioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>in fitting the two last into their places, so little room
being left).”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As time made the warrants of 1743 and 1747 more and
more antiquated, we find that regimental commanders
took ever increasing liberties with the regulations set
down in those documents. To check such departures,
a Mr. George Naylor, the then York Herald, an appointment
in the College of Arms, was given the post of
inspector of regimental colours in the year 1806. One of
Mr. Naylor’s first actions was to issue a leaflet, which he
sent to every commanding officer, setting out certain
rules of paramount importance. The leaflet also gave a
representation of both the King’s and regimental colours,
showing a blank central cartouche. This, he intimated,
was the standard pattern, and each commanding officer
was requested to fill in the details which were particular
to his own flags and return them for purposes of filing.
The designs which came back to Mr. Naylor clearly
pointed to the lack of uniformity which had sprung up
in the preparation of colours. Many flags had been
worked by ladies of title who were patrons of the local
unit, the daughters of the commanding officers, and other
such people, whose qualifications to embroider were
greater than their understanding of heraldry. To Mr.
Naylor, who knew what each flag should have borne,
the designs must frankly have been disappointing. In
some cases, the Egyptian Sphinx faced right instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>left; in others, it filled the space reserved for the central
badge; one instance is known where this device was
used as an ornament to cap the staff, and so heavily
was it cast in silver that those who carried it were “under
the necessity of unscrewing it when the regiment began
to move”; a laurel wreath instead of the union wreath
was another substituted design. One of the filled-in designs
returned to the College of Arms showed a very dilapidated
flag, but the covering letter explained that, “the George
and Dragon has nearly disappeared from our King’s
colour by a shell passing through it, though I trust his
spirit is left amongst us.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>The period following on the peace which came with the
victory of Waterloo proved of great activity in the world
of military colours. The old flags had seen much active
service and had become worn and torn, some had been
stripped from their supports in a moment of crisis and
hidden, whilst a few fell from the hands of their possessors
and became lost. Also, we must not forget that many new
battle honours had been recently won, and the fixing
of these distinctions would always be an unwise action
when the flags were showing signs of wear. Accordingly,
the regiments which were provided with new stands at
this time were considerable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The post-Waterloo period was marked by the disappearance
of the central heart-shaped shield (Figs. 7 and 8) in
favour of a circle of red silk, which was divided into a
ring and an inner circle, the first for taking the territorial
designation of the regiment, and the second for showing
the regimental badge or number. (It should, perhaps,
be stated that royal regiments and those with higher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>numbers than seventy seldom possessed territorial
designations at this time.) The central circle and ring
of crimson have remained until this day. Roman gave
place to Arabic numerals, but the latter have since died
out; the wreath became a little more elaborate, for
buds and extra leaves were introduced, and the sphinx
was definitely placed below the chief badge. A word
must be said respecting the battle honours; these were
fixed in almost any position and combination and no
rules were followed, partly because the number of honours
varied with each regiment and partly because few regiments
possessed sufficient to work up into a universal
pattern. Not many of the banners of this time were
painted, but, of course, the Foot Guards formed a notable
exception. When a line regiment flew a painted flag, it
was somewhat despised, and the inspection report was
worded in a condemning spirit. Here is an example:
“Colours only three years in use, much injured from
the circumstance of the arms and ornaments being
painted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another era of laxity sprang up about 1830. Colours
issued at this time displayed many departures from the
general rules. Arabic numerals once more found favour
for denoting the regimental numbers, county titles were
often missing, the wreath became more fanciful, and in
one case, the Northumberland Fusiliers, the badge of
St. George and the Dragon was encircled by the union
wreath, the central crimson circle being entirely missing.
Honours were commonly inscribed on the King’s colours,
which was decidedly wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>The swing of the pendulum came in 1844, for in that
year an order issued from the Horse Guards decreed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>that battle honours were not to figure on the King’s or
Queen’s colours, nothing was to be placed on them
beyond the regimental designation and the imperial
crown. This decision, which did not apply to the Foot
Guards, as they have always been a law unto themselves,
was lamented by many people, as it robbed these
colours of much of their splendour. Milne thinks that
the edict was issued because battle honours were fast
growing in number, and if many of these were sewn on to
a jack which was already a combination of seams and
stitches the results would be disastrous in partly worn
specimens.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>At this point we must go back to the years which
followed Waterloo, to discuss the standards of the
Cavalry. The Hussar regiments had discarded them
completely, and most, if not all, of the Lancers had done
the same. No Hussars or Lancers possess them to-day,
but, of course, their drum banners serve to display their
arms and appointments.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>The shape of these flags received attention at this
time. <b>The Life Guards and Horse Guards</b> continued
to fly square standards (there was an exception
in the case of The Blues, of which mention is made
later). <b>The Dragoon Guards</b> had favoured guidons
from the date of their inception in 1746, but were ordered
to carry square standards in 1837. <b>The Dragoons</b>
continued to use the guidon-shaped banner which they
selected in the days of the Stuarts, and which they still
carry. The Light Dragoons only possessed banners,
which were guidons, in three instances.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>A King’s regulation, dated June 1st, 1837, decreed
that:—</p>

<p class='c012'>The Standards of the Dragoon Guards were “to be of
silk damask embroidered and fringed with gold. The
guidons of the regiments of Dragoons to be of silk. The
flag of the standard to be 2 ft. 5 ins. wide without the
fringe, and 2 ft. 3 ins. on the lance. The flag of the
guidon of Dragoons to be 3 ft. 5 ins. to the end of the slit
in the tail, and 2 ft. 3 ins. on the lance; the first or royal
standard to be crimson, and the others of the colour of
the facings as before.” These latter were of a curious
oblong shape, with straight edges to the portions cut
away in the fly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another official decree, dated August 18th, 1858, ran
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Her Majesty has been pleased to approve that
regiments of Dragoon Guards henceforth carry but one
standard or guidon, that the second, third and fourth
standards or guidons at present in use be discontinued
and that the authorised badges, devices, distinctions,
and mottoes be, in future, borne on what is now called
the Royal or first standard or guidon in the Dragoon
Guards. N.B.—This not to apply to the Household
troops, who carry one standard per squadron.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This decree is a little difficult to understand as the third
and fourth standards had not been carried for many years
prior to the issue of the warrant. To-day, of course,
these regiments possess but a single flag, a combination
of royal and regimental colour in one.</p>

<p class='c000'>A standard which has received much prominence,
and which forms an unwelcomed exception to the rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>that the Horse Guards fly square standards (see p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>)
was presented to the Blues by William IV. in 1812, at
Windsor. We quote from a newspaper cutting:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“At 12 the King and Queen with their suite and an
escort of the Third Dragoon Guards passed along the
front of the line in open carriages and, having taken
post in the centre, the guns fired and the troops saluted.
The troops having been wheeled inwards, and the officers
called to the front, Lord Hill placing himself before his
regiment, their Majesties, accompanied by the Dukes of
Cumberland and Gloucester, and Prince George of Cumberland,
with the Duchess of Cumberland and Princess
Augusta, taking their station in the centre, the standard,
richly wrought in gold and emblazoned with the trophies
of the Blues, was consecrated by the Chaplain to the
Forces. After an address, in which the King recapitulated
the motive of his gift, and the early origin and
distinguished services of the Royal Horse Guards,
His Majesty presented the standard to Lord Hill, who
respectfully received it on the part of his regiment.
The troops then resumed line, broke into column, and
marched past in ordinary and quick time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This standard was guidon-shaped and of crimson silk;
in the centre it had the cypher of William IV., forward
and reversed, interlaced, surrounded by a number of
battle honours, above which was the royal crown. In
the four corners were crowned emblems of the rose,
thistle and shamrock.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>We are now drawing to the close of this historical
sketch, but before turning from the subject we must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>mark the year 1855. About this time the union wreath
on the colours of the infantry regiments assumed the
style as we now have it; the spear-head gave way for the
lion and crown which now adorns the pike-tops, whilst
the cord and tassels were given a definite style which has
not been altered since.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time, also, a regulation was issued declaring
that “The regimental or second colour is to be the colour
of the facing of the regiment, with the Union in the
upper canton, except those regiments which are faced
with red, white or black. In those regiments which are
faced red or white, the second colour is to be the red cross
of St. George in a white field, and the Union in the upper
canton. In those regiments which are faced with black,
the second colour is to be the St. George’s Cross: the
Union in the upper canton, the three other cantons,
black.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A more recent regulation has been framed which, in
a measure, modifies the one just quoted. We give it at
length:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“<b>The Colours of the Infantry</b> are to be of silk,
the dimensions to be 3 ft. 9 ins. flying, and 3 ft. deep on
the pike, which, including the Royal Crest, to be
8 ft. 7½ ins., the cords and tassels to be crimson and gold
mixed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Royal or First colour of every regiment (of
infantry) is to be the Great Union, the Imperial colour
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in
which the Cross of St. George is conjoined with the crosses
of St. Andrew and St. Patrick, on a blue field. The first
colour is to bear in the centre the territorial designation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>on a crimson circle with the Royal or other title within
the whole, surmounted by the Imperial Crown.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The regimental or second colour is to be the colour
of the facing of the regiment, except in those regiments
which are faced with white, in which the second colour
is to be the red cross of St. George in a white field, with
the territorial designation of the Royal or other title
displayed, as on the Royal or First colour, within the
union-wreath of roses, thistles and shamrocks, ensigned
with the Imperial crown.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The regimental or second colour of the First and
Second battalions is to bear the ancient badges, devices,
distinctions, and mottoes, which have been conferred by
Royal authority. The third and fourth battalions<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
are to carry the same colours without such devices and
distinctions as specially refer to actions or campaigns
granted in commemoration of the services of the other
two battalions. The number of each battalion, I., II.,
III., IV., is to be placed in the dexter cantons.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In those regiments which bear any ancient badge,
the badge is to be on a red ground in the centre. The
territorial designation, if practicable, to be inscribed on
a circle within the union wreath of roses, thistles, and
shamrocks, and the Royal or other title in an escroll
underneath, the whole ensigned with the Imperial crown.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No additions to, or alterations in colours is to be
made without the Sovereign’s special permission and
authority, signified through the Commander-in-Chief of
the Army.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Application for new colours is to be made to the
Director of Clothing, in accordance with the instructions
laid down in the Royal Warrant relating to clothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Foot Guards</b>, which do not come under the
heading of Infantry, follow another set of regulations
(see Chapter V.). Here it is of interest to mention that,
at one time, the authorities did everything in their power
to make them subject to the same regulations, but the
Foot Guards determined otherwise. Let us quote from
Sir Frederick Hamilton’s “History of the Grenadier
Guards.” In September, 1859, when new colours were
about to be supplied to the Second Battalion Grenadier
Guards, they were given out from the Clothing Department,
thus for the first time treating the issue of Royal
colours with about the same respect as is accorded to the
issue of a pair of regulation boots. Previous, however,
to delivery, Colonel F. W. Hamilton was requested to
inspect them, when he at once observed the substitution
of the regimental for the Queen’s colour and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>.
He also heard for the first time of the proposal that the
battalions should each select, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span></i>, one only of the
twenty-four Royal badges then belonging to them, and
retain it as their battalion badge, leaving the rest to fall
into desuetude.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>As a result of this action, the Guards protested, as only
Guards can, against this attempt to rob them of their
traditional customs. The matter was laid before Queen
Victoria, and in the month of October, 1859, she decided
that “the crimson colour, as before, should be ‘the
Queen’s’ colour, and that the distinguished company
badges, as hitherto borne, should be retained, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>emblazoned in rotation in the centre of the Union or
regimental colour. Excepting only the reduction in size,
and the addition of the proposed gold fringe, Her Majesty
would wish no further change to be made in the colours
as hitherto borne by Her Regiments of Guards. The
service badges or names of actions in which the regiments
have distinguished themselves should be borne as hitherto-fore
on both colours.” This latter decree settled probably
for all time the designs of the colours of the Foot
Guards.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have now followed the growth of the military colours
of the British Army during the last two hundred and
fifty years. In so long a period and where so many
different units are concerned, each having peculiarities of
its own, it is quite impossible to note every little change
and variation which has occurred, but the reader may be
assured that all the more important and interesting steps
in the progress of these emblems of British pluck and
patriotism have received due notice.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>STANDARDS, GUIDONS AND DRUM BANNERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD CAVALRY, DRAGOON GUARDS, AND CAVALRY OF THE LINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Among the grandest and most attractive flags which are
flown in any part of the world, those of the British
Cavalry must be assigned a high position, for, without
being gaudy, they are beautiful, elaborate, gaily coloured
and full of historic detail. The reader is invited to turn
to the second plate, and examine the five examples
given thereon. He will see that the badges—the relics
of the old baronial days—are steeped in historical fact
and military tradition, that the battle honours are
reminiscent of the glorious fights of other days; and that
the reds and blues and greens are judiciously blended
without offending the eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cavalry flags are known as standards when they
are square and guidons when swallow-tailed. The
Household Cavalry and the Dragoon Guards possess
standards and the Dragoons fly guidons. To the student
of military emblems, it is somewhat disappointing to
find that Hussars and Lancers have no flags with which
to display their splendid traditions. In their case, we
must be content to examine the cloths or banners hung
around their drums. Before taking each regiment
separately, it may be useful to state that a standard,
without the red and gold fringe, measures 2 ft. 6 ins. by
2 ft. 3 ins.; a guidon, 3 ft. 5 ins. by 2 ft. 3 ins.; and the
lance of either is 8 ft. 6 ins. long.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><b>1st Life Guards.</b>—The King’s Standard is crimson
and bears a fairly large representation of the Royal
Arms. The King’s Cypher figures in the two upper
corners. Below the Arms are placed the battle honours:
Dettingen; Peninsula; Waterloo; Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir;
South Africa, 1899-1900; Relief of Kimberley;
Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c012'>Three other standards are carried, each very similar
to the above, the central device being the chief point of
difference. (See Fig. 9.)</p>

<p class='c012'><b>2nd Life Guards.</b>—As for the 1st Life Guards, with
slight technical differences. (See Fig. 9.)</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Royal Horse Guards</b> (The Blues).—As for the 1st
Life Guards with slight technical differences. With this
regiment the battle honours are: Dettingen; Warburg;
Beaumont; Willems; Peninsula; Waterloo; Egypt,
1882; Tel-el-Kebir; South Africa, 1899-1900; Relief of
Kimberley; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Standard of Honour, in reality a guidon, which
was presented by William IV. (described elsewhere) must
be mentioned here.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>1st King’s Dragoon Guards.</b>—This standard of
crimson silk damask bears in the centre the Royal Cypher
within the Garter, and ensigned with the imperial crown.
Around this is placed the union wreath bearing roses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>shamrocks, and thistles growing upon the same stalk.
In the four corners are placed small oval labels;
the first and fourth revealing the White Horse of
Hanover, on a green mount, the background of
the horse is red; the second and third being devoted
to the regimental initials I. K.D.G., on a blue ground.
Along the vertical edges of the standard are placed
a number of golden labels, each bearing one of
the following battle honours: Blenheim; Ramillies;
Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Dettingen; Warburg; Beaumont;
Waterloo; Sevastopol; Taku Forts; Pekin;
South Africa, 1879. Below the union wreath is placed a
label inscribed: South Africa, 1901-02. This flag is
given in Fig. 10.</p>

<p class='c012'>The White Horse is shown in order to recall the part
which this regiment took in suppressing the Jacobite
Rebellions during the reigns of George I. and II.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen’s Bays).</b>—This
standard closely follows the design of the 1st (King’s)
Dragoon Guards. The centre, however, is filled with the
cypher of Queen Caroline, within the Garter. The first
and fourth corners contain the White Horse, while the
second and third bear the initials II. D.G., on a buff
ground. The battle honours are: Warburg; Willems;
Lucknow; South Africa, 1901-02.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>3rd (Prince of Wales’s) Dragoon Guards.</b>—The
Dragoon Guard type of standard is followed in this case.
The central badge is the Plume of the Prince of Wales. The
first and fourth corners reveal the White Horse, as above;
the second corner contains a small picture of the Rising
Sun, and the third, a small Red Dragon. (All these three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>devices are the appropriation of the Prince of Wales.)
The battle honours are: Blenheim; Ramillies; Oudenarde;
Malplaquet; Warburg; Beaumont; Willems;
Talavera; Albuhera; Vittoria; Peninsula; Abyssinia;
South Africa, 1901-02. (Fig. 11.)</p>

<p class='c012'><b>4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards.</b>—The Dragoon
Guard type of standard is again followed. The central
badge contains the Harp and Crown, and the Star of the
Order of St. Patrick; the second and third corners are
filled with the initials IV. D.G. on a blue ground, and the
battle honours are: Peninsula; Balaklava; Sevastopol;
Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir. The motto, “Quis separabit,”
is inscribed below the union wreath.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales’s) Dragoon
Guards.</b>—This standard follows the type for the Dragoon
Guards. The central badge is merely the regimental
designation, V. D.G. The four corners contain the White
Horse and the Rose, Thistle and Shamrock on one stalk.
The battle honours are: Blenheim; Ramillies; Oudenarde;
Malplaquet; Beaumont; Salamanca; Vittoria;
Toulouse; Peninsula; Balaklava; Sevastopol; South
Africa, 1899-1902; Defence of Ladysmith. The motto of
John Hampden, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vestigia nulla retrorsum</span>” (No going
backwards), appears below the union wreath.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers).</b>—This standard
follows the type for the Dragoon Guards. The central
badge is VI. D.G. The second and third corners have
white labels also bearing the inscription VI. D.G. The
battle honours are: Blenheim; Ramillies; Oudenarde;
Malplaquet; Warburg; Willems; Sevastopol; Delhi,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>1857; Afghanistan, 1879-80; South Africa, 1899-1902;
Relief of Kimberley; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>7th (Princess Royal’s) Dragoon Guards.</b>—The
type as before. In the centre, the coronet of her late
Majesty, the Empress and Queen Frederick of Germany
and Prussia as Princess Royal of Great Britain and Ireland.
As the facings are black, the letters VII. P.R.D.G. appear
on a groundwork of this colour in the second and third
corners. The battle honours are: Blenheim; Ramillies;
Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Dettingen; Warburg; South
Africa, 1846-7; Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir; South
Africa, 1900-02.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>1st (Royal) Dragoons.</b>—A guidon of crimson silk,
bearing in its centre the crest of England, within the
Garter, is the flag of this regiment. The imperial crown
ensigns the badge and the union wreath encircles it.
The four corners contain small labels, as was the case with
all the Dragoon Guard standards; the first and fourth
are embellished with the White Horse, and the second
and third with the initials I.D. on a blue ground. Below
the union wreath is the motto, “Spectemur agendo”
(Judge us by our deeds), and below this is a silver eagle,
a replica of the one taken from the 105th Regiment of
French Infantry at Waterloo. The battle honours are:
Tangier, 1662-80; Dettingen; Warburg; Beaumont;
Willems; Fuentes d’Onor; Peninsula; Waterloo;
Balaklava; Sevastopol; South Africa, 1899-1902;
Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys).</b>—A guidon as
for the 1st Dragoons, but with the following badge:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>A thistle within the circle, and the motto of the Order
of the Thistle, “Second to None,” below the circle.
The second and third corners contain a blue label with
the inscription II.D. The battle honours are: Blenheim;
Ramillies; Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Dettingen; Warburg;
Willems; Waterloo; Balaklava; Sevastopol;
South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Kimberley; Paardeberg.
The French eagle is placed below the motto.
(Fig. 15.)</p>

<p class='c012'>3rd (King’s Own) Hussars, 4th (Queen’s Own) Hussars,
5th (Royal Irish) Lancers—no guidons.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons.</b>—A guidon as for the
1st Dragoons, but with the following badge: The castle
of Inniskilling, flying the St. George’s Cross, and the word
“Inniskilling” underneath. The second and third
corners contain a primrose-coloured label with the
inscription VI.D. The battle honours are: Dettingen;
Warburg; Willems; Waterloo; Balaklava; Sevastopol;
South Africa, 1899-1902. (Fig. 16.)</p>

<p class='c012'>7th (Queen’s Own) Hussars, 8th (King’s Royal Irish)
Hussars, 9th (Queen’s Royal) Lancers, 10th (Prince of
Wales’s Own Royal) Hussars, 11th (Prince Albert’s Own)
Hussars, 12th (Prince of Wales’s Royal) Lancers, 13th
Hussars, 14th (King’s) Hussars, 15th (The King’s)
Hussars, 16th (The Queen’s) Lancers, 17th (Duke of
Cambridge’s Own) Lancers, 18th (Queen Mary’s Own)
Hussars, 19th (Queen Alexandra’s Own Royal) Hussars,
20th Hussars, 21st (Empress of India’s) Lancers—none
of these regiments fly guidons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost as attractive as the standards and guidons
are the drum banners, or drum cloths, of the cavalry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>These appointments are usually made of brilliant coloured
fabric, richly embroidered in gold, and bear the devices
and, at times, the battle honours peculiar to each
regiment. To our minds, it is unfortunate that the
material chosen in making them does not always correspond
with the facings of the unit. Hussars and Lancers,
it is pleasing to know, have not been deprived of these
banners or cloths.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three sister regiments of <b>Life Guards</b> and <b>Horse
Guards</b> have chosen very similar drum banners. They
are crimson, and bear the Royal Arms, with two flying
cherubs placed above. Gold embroidery enters largely
into the decoration of these fine emblems. No battle
honours are shown. <b>The 1st Dragoon Guards</b> carry
a blue banner, richly embroidered, with the Royal Arms.
<b>The 2nd Dragoon Guards</b> display their nickname,
“Bays,” within a golden wreath, surmounted by an
imperial crown, all on a cream-buff ground. The motto,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro Rege et Patria</span>” (For King and Country), is inscribed
on a red scroll. <b>The 3rd Dragoon Guards</b>
have selected a banner of the same colour as their facings,
namely, yellow. The Prince of Wales’s plume, the motto,
“Ich Dien” (I serve), the White Horse, the Rising Sun,
the Red Dragon of Cadwallader, and a union wreath all
appear on this fine cloth. <b>The 4th Dragoon Guards</b>
carry a blue banner bearing the Harp and Crown and the
Star of the Order of St. Patrick, emblems showing the
Irish origin of the regiment. The White Horse and a
union wreath also enter into the scheme of decoration.
<b>The 5th Dragoon Guards</b> display the White
Horse, the regimental initials V. D.G., and the title,
“Princess Charlotte of Wales,” on a blue scroll, all on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>a crimson cloth; (the facings are dark green). <b>The 6th
Dragoon Guards</b> have a semi-circular banner of white
material, tastefully decorated with a number of blue
labels and a gold wreath encircling the regimental badge—a
shield supported by a pair of crossed carbines, surmounted
by an imperial crown. <b>The 7th Dragoon
Guards</b> carry a neat blue banner decorated with
the Royal Arms, a golden wreath and a scroll inscribed
“The Princess Royal’s Dragoon Guards.” Turning now
to the <b>1st Royal Dragoons</b>, we have a dark blue cloth
bearing, in gold, the Crest of England within the Garter,
the Eagle, of which we spoke, a wreath of oak and
laurel, the motto “Spectemur agendo,” and the regimental
title. <b>The 2nd Dragoons</b>, the Scots Greys, show a
light crimson banner, having in the centre the Thistle,
around which is inscribed the motto, “Nemo me impune
lacessit” (No one hurts me with impunity). The French
Eagle, two flaming grenades, a wreath of golden thistles,
and the motto, “Second to none,” are also given.
<b>The 3rd (King’s Own) Hussars</b> have silver decorated
drums, and possess no drum cloths. <b>The 4th Hussars</b>
have the Royal Arms and a number of battle honours
on their yellow banner. <b>The 5th Lancers</b> own a neat
green cloth which bears the Harp and Crown, the motto,
“Quis separabit” (Who shall separate?), a golden-brown
wreath, two crossed lances, and a scroll inscribed
with the words, “Fifth Royal Irish.” No battle honours
appear. This cloth is shown in Fig. 13. <b>The 6th
Dragoons</b> reveal their connection with Inniskilling by
using the castle as a badge. A golden wreath and the
imperial crown are also given, all on a yellow background.
<b>The 7th Hussars</b> possess a dark blue banner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>ornamented with the monogram Q.O. (i.e., Queen’s
Own) interlaced within a garter, and surmounted by
a crown. Battle honours are given on light blue
scrolls. <b>The 8th Irish Hussars</b> display the harp and
crown, a number of battle honours, and the regimental
initials 8.K.R.I.H. (King’s Royal Irish Hussars)
on a brownish-red cloth. The motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pristinæ
virtutis memores</span>” (The memory of former valour), is
given on a blue scroll. One of the most attractive
designs is that used by <b>the 9th Lancers</b>. The cypher
of Queen Adelaide, reversed and interlaced, within a
garter, is surmounted by an imperial crown, and
backed by a pair of crossed lances. The numerous
battle honours are given in a circular ring, whilst the
figures IX. are placed below the ring. The cloth is
crimson. <b>The 10th Hussars</b> have the alternative title
of the Prince of Wales’s Own. Their banner, accordingly,
bears the Prince’s plume and motto. The honours are
woven into a golden wreath which encircles the Rising
Sun and Cadwallader’s Red Dragon. The material is
royal blue. <b>The 11th Hussars</b> display the late Prince
Consort’s crest and motto, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Treu und fest</span>” (True and
firm), the Egyptian Sphinx, the regimental initials,
XI.H., all surmounted by a crown, and the inscription,
“Prince Albert’s Own Hussars.” The cloth is crimson.
<b>The 12th Lancers</b> also have a crimson banner, embellished
by the plume of the Prince of Wales, the
Egyptian Sphinx, the regimental number XII., a golden
wreath, and a pair of crossed lances. <b>The 13th Hussars</b>
wear the royal cypher enwreathed with leaves of laurel
and oak, the imperial crown, and the usual array of
battle honours. The motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viret in Æternum</span>”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>(Virile for ever), figures on this cream-buff banner.
(Fig. 14). <b>The 14th Hussars</b>, being known as the
14th King’s Light Dragoons, bear this title on a
golden scroll, which is placed above the royal crest
within the Garter. The battle honours are inscribed
upon the leaves of a laurel wreath. The cloth is
crimson. Of the same colour is the drum banner
of <b>the 15th Hussars</b>. This regiment displays the
royal crest, the King’s cypher, the figures XV., the
battle honours, and a golden wreath of laurel and oak.
A royal blue cloth is carried by <b>the 16th Lancers</b>;
it bears the crossed lances, which figure on all Lancer
drum cloths, except those of <b>the 17th Lancers</b>. In
this case, the well-known device of a skull and crossbones
is placed within a garter, surmounted by a crown
and enwreathed with a band of oak and laurel leaves.
The cloth is deep blue. (Fig. 12.) <b>The 18th Hussars</b>
are known by their deep crimson banner, bearing, among
the battle honours, the inscriptions, XVIII. Hussars,
Queen Mary’s Own, and the motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro rege, pro lege,
pro patria conamur</span>” (For king, for law, for country we
strive). <b>The 19th Hussars</b> have a white cloth, showing
the letter A, interlaced with the Dannebrog,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> below
which is the White Elephant of Assaye, and around it a
number of labels bearing battle honours, and the inscription,
Queen Alexandra’s Own Royal Hussars. <b>The
20th Hussars</b> favour a crimson banner, which is embellished
by a large golden wreath from which are growing
roses, thistles and shamrocks. The royal cypher and the
imperial crown are given the central position. The last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>cavalry regiment, <b>the 21st (Empress of India’s)
Lancers</b>, owns probably the most fanciful drum banner.
The letters V.R.I. are cleverly interlaced and supported
by a pair of crossed lances, the whole encircled
by a union wreath and the imperial crown. “Khartoum”
is inscribed upon a dark blue scroll. The
banner is French grey.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>YEOMANRY GUIDONS AND DRUM BANNERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Following on the Cavalry, in the Army List, comes the
Yeomanry, which forms part of the Territorial Force.
This unit of the Army is divided into Dragoon, Hussar
and Lancer divisions, an example of each being the Westminster
Dragoons, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars,
and the City of London Rough Eiders. The Dragoons,
as a rule, are the only section which carry flags—in all
cases they are guidons—but it must be mentioned that
some Dragoon regiments display no colours, whilst a
certain few of the other divisions possess these emblems,
though they may not have received official recognition.
Most regiments own drum cloths, but some of those
raised since the Boer War carry no drums and, in consequence,
wear no drum cloths. In one or two instances,
i.e., in the North Somerset Yeomanry, ornamental drums
are provided which need no cloth embellishments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yeomanry guidons are made of crimson material,
edged with gold and red fringe; the pole is surmounted
with the Royal lion and crown; and, in most cases, the
distinctive badge is ensigned with the Royal crown, and
encircled by the union wreath. The only battle honour
inscribed on these flags is “South Africa,” but all regiments
do not possess it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><b>The Berks Yeomanry</b>, which has its headquarters at
Hungerford, flies the standard pattern of guidon, with a
White Horse as central badge. This animal, as revealed
on the banner, is a very poor specimen, but as it is an
imitation of the one cut in the turf on the downs, we can
appreciate the reason for its adoption.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Derbyshire Yeomanry</b> has the united red and
white rose for its badge. This flower is ensigned with
the imperial crown and, therefore, the ordinary crown is
not placed above and outside the circular label, as is
usual.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Essex Yeomanry</b> boasts of a motto: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decus
et Tutamen</span>” (Honour and safety), which is inscribed on
a scroll placed under the badge, consisting of a red
escutcheon charged with three seaxes. These weapons
are reminders of the county’s connections with bygone
Saxon occupation. (Fig. 41.)</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Fife and Forfar Regiment</b>, which hails from
Cupar, is proud of its badge, a representation of the
Thane of Fife. Readers of Macbeth will remember that
Macduff was a descendant of the original Thane of Fife,
a fine soldier who obtained a grant of the shire of Fife
from Kenneth II. in recognition of his assistance when
fighting against the Picts.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Hampshire Carabiniers</b> have the appropriate
device of two carbines in saltire. They also have a rose
at each corner of the guidon, white in the first and fourth
corners and red in the second and third.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Herts Yeomanry</b> have a stag for device, whilst
<b>the Lanarkshire Yeomanry</b>, a regiment possessing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>alternative lengthy title of “Queen’s Own Royal Glasgow
and Lower Ward of Lanarkshire,” flies a flag of the
ordinary type revealing no particular badge.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Duke of Lancaster’s Own</b> bear the appropriate
red rose of the House of Lancaster, and here we may
mention that <b>the Yorkshire Dragoons Yeomanry</b>
(Queen’s Own) display the white rose of York.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Lothians and Border Horse Yeomanry</b> show a
garb which, in non-heraldic terms, is a shock of corn.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Montgomeryshire Yeomanry</b> use a red dragon
with green wings as the central badge, which is surrounded
by a union wreath not of the regulation design.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Norfolk Yeomanry</b> has broken away from the
traditional pattern of guidon. In each of the four comers
is the Royal Cypher ensigned with the imperial crown,
and in the centre are the Royal Arms. The Royal
residence in Norfolk, and the King’s special interest in
this county probably account for the presence of these
emblems.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Scottish Horse</b> display the cross of St. Andrew
on a blue groundwork, as the central badge, whilst in the
four corners is the thistle ensigned with the imperial
crown. This is one of the most pleasing guidons of the
Yeomanry Force.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Shropshire Yeomanry</b> have as the central badge
on their guidon a rendering of the arms of the Shropshire
County Council (i.e., three tigers’ heads).</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Sussex Yeomanry</b> display a badge comprising
six martlets perched in three rows, all on a Blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>background, whilst <b>the Northamptonshire Yeomanry</b>
give another rendering of the well-known white horse.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Westminster Dragoons</b>, otherwise known as
the 2nd County of London Yeomanry, have the Royal
Cypher and Crown as central badge, whilst in the first
and fourth corners are crossed axes, and in the
second and third, Beaufort’s portcullis. These four
devices are encircled by a union wreath of special
design. (Fig. 42.)</p>

<p class='c000'>If we leave the Yeomanry guidons, and turn to the
drum banners, a more interesting set of emblems will be
brought to our notice. The guidons may be accused of
possessing a somewhat monotonous semblance one with
the other, but this is not a characteristic of the drum
cloths. They are gay-coloured, smart in appearance,
and endowed with emblematic ornamentation of an
interesting nature.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Ayreshires</b> have a neat crimson cloth, showing
a crown, a union wreath, and scrolls bearing the inscription,
“The Earl of Carrick’s Own Ayreshire Yeomanry
Cavalry.” <b>The Berks’</b> drum cloth is of the same colour,
while the ornamentation consists of the initials R.B.Y.C.
in writing, with the imperial crown above, and a crescent
and star below. Another crimson cloth is that of <b>the
Cheshires</b>, which displays the plume of the Prince of
Wales as central badge. <b>The Derbyshire Yeomanry</b>
use the red and white rose as on the guidon, but it is
worked in gold threads on a crimson cloth. <b>The Royal
1st Devon</b> and the <b>Royal North Devon</b> both bear
the Royal Cypher, ensigned with the imperial crown on
a crimson groundwork. The former, however, has gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>fringe, but the latter, silver-white and blue. <b>The
Dorsets</b> display the same royal emblems within a silver
laurel wreath, also on crimson. <b>The Hampshires</b> have
an elaborate blue cloth, with wide gold fringe, on which
appears carbines in saltire, the imperial crown, the red
and white rose and a union wreath. <b>The West Kent’s</b>
is crimson, and bears the white county horse within the
garter, surmounted by an imperial crown. The motto,
“Invicta” (Unconquered), and the inscription “West
Kent Yeomanry,” are woven into a laurel wreath. A
blue cloth is used by the <b>Lanarkshire (Queen’s Own)
Yeomanry</b>. The design is neat, fairly simple, and consists
of the Royal Cypher, within a garter, ensigned by
the imperial crown, and surrounded by a wreath of
thistles. <b>The Lancashire Hussars</b> also carry a crimson
banner; it bears the Royal Cypher, interlaced, surmounted
by the imperial crown, and has below it the
Lancastrian rose. A wreath of red roses encircles these
devices. <b>The Duke of Lancaster’s Own</b> is a dark blue
fabric having, as central badge, the three lions of England
on a shield surcharged with a white label or bar having
three points. The imperial crown also appears, and the
whole is framed by a laurel and oak wreath. The red
rose ensigned by a crown figures in the two lower corners.
<b>The City of London Rough Riders</b> have an attractive
purple banner bearing the City arms within a circle and
a wreath. <b>The 1st County of London</b>, better known as
the Duke of Cambridge’s Hussars, favours a green cloth,
having, as central badge, a seven-pointed crowned star,
within a wreath. The Duke’s cypher appears in the four
corners, and the regimental motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro aris et focis</span>,” is
given on the star. Another green banner is that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><b>3rd County of London Sharpshooters</b>. This appointment
is ornamented with a pair of crossed rifles and a
crown within a circle, ensigned with the imperial crown
and framed by a wreath of laurel. <b>Lothians and Border
Horse Yeomanry</b> have a blue banner, revealing the
garb, before mentioned, and a wreath of thistles. <b>The
Montgomeryshire Yeomanry</b> display a crimson cloth
embellished, in the centre, by a rose, thistle, and shamrock
springing from a single stalk. (Cf. the regimental standard
of the 2nd Life Guards, Fig. 9). In the first and
fourth corners is the White Horse of Hanover, and in
the second and third corners, the Red Dragon of Wales.
<b>The Northumberland Hussars</b> display a blue cloth
in the centre of which figures the regimental cypher,
with a crown above. On a scroll appears the name of the
regiment, and two sprays of golden laurel complete the
ornamentation. A banner of mantua-purple cloth
belongs to <b>the Oxfordshire Yeomanry</b>. It bears the
regimental cypher and a laurel wreath, both in silver,
an imperial crown, in gold, and three red scrolls, inscribed,
“Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars.” <b>The
Shropshire Yeomanry</b> drum cloth carries the same
device as the guidon, but it is blue, and has the motto,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Floreat Salopia</span>” (Flourish Shropshire). The well-known
Stafford knot, which has belonged to the heads
of the Stafford family from earliest times, appears as
the central badge on the blue drum cloth of <b>the
Staffordshire Yeomanry</b>. The fringe of this banner is
unusual, being for the most part, triangles of gold and
silver embroidery. <b>The Suffolk Yeomanry</b> uses a green
cloth, in the centre of which figures the castle and
key, and the date 1793, devices to remind us of the siege
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of Gibraltar. A golden laurel wreath is also given, as
well as the motto, “Liberty, property, loyalty.” This
is a very fine appointment. <b>The Royal Wiltshires</b>,
having the alternative title of “Prince of Wales’s Own,”
naturally reveals the plume of the Prince. This is shown
in a garter, which is surmounted by the Royal lion and
crown; all on a crimson cloth. <b>The Yorkshire Dragoons</b>
and <b>the Yorkshire Hussars</b> must not be confused.
The first has a blue cloth bearing the white rose and the
title, “Queen’s Own,” whilst the second displays a deep
scarlet, almost black, drum banner, with the white rose,
the plume of the Prince of Wales, and the title “Princess
of Wales’s Own.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In our limited space it has only been possible to give
the chief features of these drum banners—sufficient,
however, to assist the reader in recognising the appointments.
They are, we must add, of the utmost beauty,
and equal in point of interest to those of the regular
Cavalry.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE COLOURS OF THE FOOT GUARDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tradition has perhaps a stronger hold in the Foot
Guards than in any of the Infantry units dealt with in
the chapter which follows. Accordingly, the reader
must not be surprised to find that most of the general
rules which affect the colours of the line regiments do
not apply to the Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish
and Welsh Guards. We have already mentioned that
the King’s colour, as a rule, consists of a Union Jack,
whilst the regimental colour is a flag bearing the devices
and honours of the regiment to which it belongs. In the
Guards, however, this rule is reversed, and the Jack
constitutes the regimental, and the banner, charged with
devices, the King’s colour. Another difference which
may be mentioned concerns the battle honours. These
are not placed on the royal colours in the majority of
foot regiments, but the Guards show them on both the
King’s and regimental colours. (The Irish and Welsh
Guards at the time of writing possess no battle honours,
they being comparatively new units.)</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Grenadier Guards</b> have three flags, known as
the Colonel’s, the Lieutenant-Colonel’s, and the Major’s
colours, which are used as the King’s colour in the first,
second and third battalions respectively.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The Colonel’s or King’s first battalion colour consists
of a crimson silk banner bearing an imperial crown above
a flaming grenade. (Fig. 17.) On either side is a column
of twelve tablets in gold, each inscribed with the name of
one of the following battle distinctions:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Tangier, 1680; Namur, 1695; Gibraltar, 1704-5;
Blenheim; Ramillies; Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Dettingen;
Lincelles; Egmont-op-Zee; Corunna; Barrosa;
Nive; Peninsula; Waterloo; Alma; Inkerman;
Sevastopol; Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir; Suakin,
1885; Khartoum; South Africa, 1899-1902; Modder
River.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant-Colonel’s or the King’s colour of the
second battalion consists of a crimson silk banner bearing
in the dexter canton, a small Union Jack, whilst in the
centre of the crimson field is the Royal Cypher, reversed
and interlaced, having above it an imperial crown,
and, below, a flaming grenade. Battle honours also
appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Major’s colour, which serves as that of the King’s
for the third battalion, is like the above, but from the
sinister or bottom right hand corner of the small Jack
issues a pile-wavy or, that is, a tongue of flame worked
in gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the foregoing, there are three regimental
colours, one for each of the three battalions. These
flags bear the device of the Union Jack, full size, upon
the four red centre limbs of which figure the Royal Crown,
a flaming grenade, certain battle distinctions, and a
special badge.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The special badge varies not only with each battalion,
but with every new flag that is supplied to replace a
discarded one. There is a series of thirty of these badges,
each one of which is a company badge of the Grenadier
Guards. They are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'>1st Company.—A golden lion wearing a crown and standing
upon another crown (i.e., the Royal crest as given on the current
sixpenny piece). In the upper staff corner of the colour is
placed in all these flags the company number in Roman
numerals.</p>

<p class='c012'>2nd Company.—A red Tudor rose with a white centre.</p>

<p class='c012'>3rd Company.—A <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur de lys</span>.</p>

<p class='c012'>4th Company.—A portcullis with chains hanging from it.
This device was taken by Henry VII. from the badge of the
House of Somerset. His mother, it will be remembered, was
Margaret, daughter of John, Duke of Somerset.</p>

<p class='c012'>5th Company.—A white rose in a glory or sun. This was the
badge of the Earldom of March.</p>

<p class='c012'>6th Company.—A thistle and rose, stalked and leaved. It
was the device adopted by James I. to signify the union which
had been effected between England and Scotland.</p>

<p class='c012'>7th Company.—The harp of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c012'>8th Company.—The red dragon of Cadwallader, on a green
mount. This device was used by the sovereigns of the united
Houses of York and Lancaster. It was taken by Henry VII.
to remind people of his descent from Cadwallader, whose shield
bore the red dragon as a supporter.</p>

<p class='c012'>9th Company.—A white greyhound, with a red collar, standing
on a green mount. An old badge belonging to the Earl of
Richmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>10th Company.—A sun in splendour with a human face,
a badge selected by Richard II. when he desired to improve
upon the badge of his father. Richard used a full sun in contradistinction
to his father’s rising or partial sun.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>11th Company.—A white unicorn of Scotland, gorged with a
golden prince’s coronet and chain, on a green mount. This was
an old badge of James I.</p>

<p class='c012'>12th Company.—A white antelope, gorged with a ducal crown
and chain, standing on a green mount—a well known device
of Henry IV., son of John of Gaunt. He appropriated this
animal from the escutcheon of the House of Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c012'>13th Company.—A white hart, gorged with a ducal crown
and chain, on a green mount; a badge assumed by Richard II.
from the devices of his mother, Joan, daughter of Edmund,
Earl of Kent.</p>

<p class='c012'>14th Company.—A white falcon with extended wings, perched
on the barrel of a closed golden fetterlock. Edward IV., in addition
to the device of the white rose which was taken from the
Earl of March, selected this white falcon from the badge of
his grandfather, the first Duke of York.</p>

<p class='c012'>15th Company.—A red rose with green stalks and leaves
(Fig. 18).</p>

<p class='c012'>16th Company.—A white swan, gorged with a ducal crown
and chain, on a green mount. It may be remembered that
Humphrey, Earl of Hereford, used a swan argent, and his daughter,
when she married Henry IV., took the same device.</p>

<p class='c012'>17th Company.—A white falcon, crowned and bearing a
sceptre, standing on the stump of a tree out of which is growing
a branch bearing three roses, one white and two red. This was
Elizabeth’s badge, to remind people that she was descended from
both the Houses of York and Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c012'>18th Company.—A stump of a tree which was the badge
of Edward III.; assumed by him to point out how flourishing
was his family.</p>

<p class='c012'>19th Company.—A golden sceptre and sword proper—a device
used by the House of Stuart.</p>

<p class='c012'>20th Company.—A green oak tree on a green mount. In the
branches of the tree may be seen the head of Charles II. peeping
out. This is an emblem to remind us of his hiding after the
Battle of Worcester.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>21st Company.—A sun rising behind clouds. This is a badge
of Edward the Black Prince, which he assumed when he felt
that his princely deeds were on the point of revealing him to
the world as a man possessing a glorious future.</p>

<p class='c012'>22nd Company.—A beacon or cresset with flames. This
device was used by Henry V. when he wished to tell people
that his deeds would shed a radiance similar to those of the
flames of a fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>23rd Company.—Silver ostrich feathers, crossed. The Lancastrians
took this device.</p>

<p class='c012'>24th Company.—A white hart with golden antlers springing
from the gate of a golden triple towered castle. This badge
appears to be of Irish origin.</p>

<p class='c012'>25th Company.—A red cross of St. George, on a silver shield.</p>

<p class='c012'>26th Company.—The arms of Nassau. A golden lion rampant,
crowned, standing near to eight billets on a blue shield. The
Counts of Nassau, it will be remembered, were connected by
marriage with the English Royal family.</p>

<p class='c012'>27th Company.—The badge of the Order of the Bath, a device
comprising the rose, thistle, shamrock, etc.</p>

<p class='c012'>28th Company.—Three crests of German origin, emanating
from Saxony, Brunswick and Hanover.</p>

<p class='c012'>29th Company.—A shamrock.</p>

<p class='c012'>30th Company.—The crest of the Prince Consort, i.e., from
out of a ducal Coronet appears a pillar crowned with a coronet
from which issues a plume of three peacocks’ feathers. The
arms of Saxony are shown on the pillar.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Coldstream Guards</b> also have three flags,
known as the Colonel’s, the Lieutenant-Colonel’s, and
the Major’s colours, which are used as the King’s
colour in the first, second, and third battalions
respectively.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Colonel’s or King’s first battalion colour consists
of a crimson silk banner bearing the Star of the Order of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the Garter, i.e., the cross of St. George in the garter, on
an eight-rayed star. A Sphinx superscribed “Egypt”
is placed below, and at the foot of the Sphinx is a scroll,
bearing the inscription, “South Africa’, 1899-1902.”
(Fig. 19.) On either side of these devices is a column of
ten tablets in gold, each inscribed with the name of one
of the following battle distinctions:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Tangier, 1680; Namur, 1695; Gibraltar, 1704-5;
Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Dettingen; Lincelles; Talavera;
Barrosa; Fuentes d’Onor; Nive; Peninsula;
Waterloo; Alma; Inkerman; Sevastopol; Egypt,
1882; Tel-el-Kebir; Suakin, 1885; South Africa, 1899-1902;
Modder River.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant-Colonel’s or the King’s colour of the
second battalion consists of a crimson silk banner bearing
in the upper corner next to the staff a small Union Jack,
whilst in the centre of the crimson field is a star of eight
rays and, below it, the Sphinx of Egypt. Battle honours
also appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Major’s colour, which serves as that of the King’s
for the third battalion, is like the above, but from the
bottom right-hand corner of the small Jack issues a pile-wavy
or.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the foregoing, there are three regimental
colours, one for each of the three battalions. These flags
bear the device of the Union Jack, full size, upon the
four red centre limbs of which figure the Royal Crown,
certain battle distinctions, the Sphinx of Egypt, and a
special badge.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>The special badges vary as set out for the Grenadier
Guards. They are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'>1st Company.—A white lion on a green mount, surmounted
by an imperial crown. (Fig. 20).</p>

<p class='c012'>2nd Company.—The Prince of Wales’ feathers in silver, with
gold quills, encircled by the coronet of Edward the Black
Prince.</p>

<p class='c012'>3rd Company.—A white tiger, having flames of fire emitted
from the mouth and ears, on a green mount.</p>

<p class='c012'>4th Company.—Crossed swords, with points upwards, in silver.
The hilt and pommel are in gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>5th Company.—The St. George and Dragon.</p>

<p class='c012'>6th Company.—A red rose with golden seeds and green thorns,
in a garter, a badge of Henry IV. of Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c012'>7th Company.—A centaur provided with a bow and arrow,
on a green mount. These were the royal arms of Stephen.</p>

<p class='c012'>8th Company.—Two crossed sceptres in gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>9th Company.—The knot of the collar of the Order of the
Garter. This was the royal device of Richard II.</p>

<p class='c012'>10th Company.—A carbuncle, in gold. This precious stone
formed one of the badges of Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, whose
other badge, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">planta genista</span>, is world famous.</p>

<p class='c012'>11th Company.—A white boar, passant, bristled gold, on a
green mount—a badge of the House of Warwick.</p>

<p class='c012'>12th Company.—A dun cow, on a green mount. The dun
cow of Dunsmore Heath, near Rugby, has the tradition of being
slain by Guy of Warwick.</p>

<p class='c012'>13th Company.—A red and white rose impaled with a golden
pomegranate bearing green leaves. This device was brought
from Spain by Katherine of Arragon.</p>

<p class='c012'>14th Company.—A white horse, galloping, on a green mount.</p>

<p class='c012'>15th Company.—The crown of Charlemange, in gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>16th Company.—The same badge as given for the 28th Company
of Grenadier Guards.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><b>The Scots Guards</b> have three flags, known as the
Colonel’s, the Lieutenant-Colonel’s, and the Major’s
colours, the first two of which are used as the King’s
colour in the first and second battalions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Colonel’s or King’s first battalion colour (Fig. 21)
consists of a crimson silk banner, bearing an imperial crown
surmounting the Royal Arms of Scotland. Under these
are placed the motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">En! Ferus Hostis</span>” (Lo! A
savage foe), and the Sphinx of Egypt. On either side is
a column of seven tablets, in gold, each bearing the name
of one of the following battle distinctions: Namur, 1695;
Dettingen; Lincelles; Talavera; Barrosa; Fuentes
d’Onor; Nive; Peninsula; Waterloo; Alma; Inkerman;
Sevastopol; Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir; Suakin,
1885; South Africa, 1899-1902; Modder River.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant-Colonel’s or the King’s colour of the
second battalion consists of a crimson silk banner bearing
in the dexter canton a small Union Jack, whilst in the
centre of the crimson field is an imperial crown, a Tudor
rose, a thistle and shamrock, and the Sphinx of Egypt.
On this flag is the motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unita fortior</span>” (By union
stronger). Battle honours also appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Major’s colour, which does not serve as that of the
King’s colour, as there is no third battalion, bears the
star of the Order of the Thistle, with a small Union Jack,
from which issues a pile-wavy. There is also the Egyptian
Sphinx, and a motto, “Nemo me impune lacessit” (No
one provokes me with impunity).</p>

<p class='c000'>The regimental colours of the Scots Guards consist
of a full-size Union flag, emblazoned with a crown and
Sphinx, and bear the badges of the companies, on lines
similar to those laid down in connection with the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>former regiments of Guards. The first twelve badges
are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'>1st Company.—A red lion standing on an imperial crown,
all on a silver shield. The motto is “In defence.”</p>

<p class='c012'>2nd Company.—A hand grenade with a lighted fuse and the
motto “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terrorem affero</span>” (I carry terror with me).</p>

<p class='c012'>3rd Company.—The red rampant lion of Scotland. Motto,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Intrepidus</span>” (Undaunted).</p>

<p class='c012'>4th Company.—The cross with a representation of St. Andrew,
upon a star of silver, all under a thistle. Motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo me
impune lacessit</span>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>5th Company.—A red lion, passant and full-faced, on a gold
shield. Motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Timere nescius</span>” (I do not know fear).</p>

<p class='c012'>6th Company.—A blue griffin, on a gold shield, the badge
of Edward III. Motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Belloque ferox</span>” (And ferocious in
war).</p>

<p class='c012'>7th Company.—A salamander standing amidst flames—the
badge of Francis I. of Orleans, who agreed to marry Mary, the
sister of Henry VIII., when Louis XII. died, on consideration
that Henry renounced all claims to the French throne. It may

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE COLOURS OF THE INFANTRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Each regiment of the Infantry possesses two colours,
the King’s colour—which is known as the Queen’s, when
the reigning sovereign is a woman—and the regimental
colour. There are two exceptions to this rule: (<i>a</i>) rifle
regiments do not carry these emblems, and (<i>b</i>) a few
units possess a third colour, usually awarded for some
service of exceptional merit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The King’s colour in every Infantry regiment consists
of the Union flag with the regimental badge or number
placed in the centre of the St. George’s Cross, the imperial
crown figuring above whichever device is used.
When the regimental number appears on the King’s
colour, Roman figures are employed<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> (see Fig. 25);
when a badge, it is placed within a circle around which
is printed the regimental title.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> (See Fig. 46).</p>

<p class='c000'>The regimental colour is more involved in character.
First, there is a central device bearing one of the following:
a badge (as Fig. 26), the regimental number (as Fig. 29),
the battalion number (as Fig. 30), or the name of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>battalion (as Fig. 40). Around this is placed a crimson
ring, upon which is printed the name of the regiment.
Above the badge, or ensigning it, is the imperial crown.
Encircling all this is the union wreath, consisting of
roses, thistles, shamrocks, and appropriate leaves, all
growing from the same stalk—a very pleasing allusion
to the fusion of England, Ireland and Scotland. Then
comes the array of battle honours; when these are numerous
they are placed upon a wreath which in turn encircles
the union wreath. This wreath is usually composed of
green foliage, but when the groundwork of the flag is of
this hue, the wreath is golden. When the battle honours
are not numerous, a few are placed on either side, also
above and below the union wreath. Territorial force
battalions have but one honour, that for South Africa.
This is placed below the union wreath.</p>

<p class='c000'>The four corners of the colour may contain devices,
or they may be left blank. In some flags a small union
still figures in the dexter canton, but the tendency to-day
is to omit this. In the case of Fig. 39, which is the
colour of the Honourable Artillery Company, the small
union is given to show the manner of its display. It
should be mentioned that the number of the battalion
is often printed in the dexter canton.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colour of the flag depends upon the facings of
the regiment; if these are blue, that is to say, if the
regiment is a royal one, the groundwork of the flag is
blue; if these are yellow, buff, or green, the groundwork
of the flag is yellow, buff or green; but if the facings are
white or scarlet, the flag is white, and bears the red cross
of St. George. Lastly, if the facings are black, the flag
is black, with the red cross superimposed. As the facings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>for all battalions of a regiment are not necessarily the
same, it is more convenient in the following descriptions
to give the colour of the facings, and leave the
reader to bear in mind the facts set out above.</p>

<p class='c000'>Battle honours are, as a rule, shown on the regimental
colours only.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment).</b>—Facings,
blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a>—The Royal Cypher within the Collar of the
Order of the Thistle, with the badge appendant. In each
of the four corners the thistle within the circle and motto
of the Order, ensigned with the imperial crown. The
Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Collar of the Order of the Thistle is made of gold,
and consists of alternate thistles and sprigs of rue enamelled
in proper colours. The badge is a golden image of
St. Andrew, dressed in purple and green, holding a
cross before him. The motto is “Nemo me impune
lacessit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Tangier, 1680; Namur, 1695;
Blenheim; Ramillies; Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Louisburg;
Havannah; St. Lucia, 1803; Egmont-op-Zee; Corunna; Busaco;
Salamanca; Vittoria; St. Sebastian; Nive; Peninsula; Niagara;
Waterloo; Nagpore; Maheidpoor; Ava; Alma; Inkerman;
Sevastopol; Taku Forts; Pekin, 1860; South Africa, 1899-1902.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Royal Scots hold the distinction of being the
oldest regiment in our army. It was raised under the
name of Le Regiment de Douglas, about 1633. King
George V. presented colours to the second battalion
in 1913.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><b>The Queen’s (Royal West Surrey Regiment).</b>—Facings
for the first four battalions, blue; for the fifth,
scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Cypher of Queen Catherine, within the
Garter. In each of the four corners the Paschal Lamb,
with motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pristinæ virtutis memor</span>” (The memory
of former valour). Below the central badge, the motto,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vel exuviæ triumphant</span>” (Arms triumph surely). A
naval crown, superscribed “1st June, 1794.” The Sphinx,
superscribed “Egypt.” This device was granted after
the campaign of 1801.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Paschal Lamb is often spoken of as being a badge
of the House of Braganza, but Sir Sibbald Scott, an
authority on these matters, declares that it was never
an emblem of the royal house of Portugal; it gained this
reputation by figuring in a picture which Sir Peter Lely
painted of Catherine. The regiment used the lamb
“without any obvious meaning, and that quite lately it
assumed the paschal attributes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Tangier, 1662-80; Namur,
1695; Vimiera; Corunna; Salamanca; Vittoria; Pyrenees;

united Red and White Rose, ensigned with the imperial
crown. Motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veteri frondescit honore</span>” (By its
venerable honour may it flourish). This flag is shown
in Fig. 27.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The origin of the dragon is obscure, but the Buffs have
descended from the Trained Bands of the City of London,
and probably the animal is a corruption of the City’s
griffin. The connection with the City permits this regiment
to march through the streets of this area with
drums beating and bayonets fixed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Blenheim; Ramillies; Oudenarde;
Malplaquet; Dettingen; Guadaloupe, 1759; Douro;

Relief of Kimberley; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Readers who have the opportunity of visiting the
Guildhall should see the colours which were retired in
1906, and then presented to the Lord Mayor of London.
They are exhibited in a glass case.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The King’s Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment).</b>—Facings,
blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Royal Cypher within the Garter. In each
of the four corners the Lion of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Garter is dark blue, edged with gold, and bears the
motto, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honi soit qui mal y pense</span>,” in gilt letters.</p>

South Africa, 1879; South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

Peninsula; Lucknow; Afghanistan, 1878-80; Khartoum; South

<p class='c012'>The honour “Wilhelmstahl” figures as “Willems” in certain
other colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The term “gosling green” has been obtained from
Colonel Gosling, an early and famous leader of the “Old
and Bold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This regiment carries a third colour, also of gosling
green, on occasions of ceremony to celebrate the taking of
an enemy colour at Wilhelmstahl.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colours of the 5th battalion are shown in Fig. 35.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Warwickshire Regiment.</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The antelope. In each of the four corners, the
united Red and White Rose, slipped, ensigned with the
imperial crown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably, the antelope is used with no more significance
than is the case with the paschal lamb of the West
Surreys. Legend says, however, that the “Saucy Sixth”
captured from a Moorish force a standard bearing an
antelope as its device and they appropriated it as their
own badge in remembrance of this prowess.</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Namur, 1695; Martinique,
1794; Roliça; Vimiera; Corunna; Vittoria; Pyrenees; Nivelle;

<p class='c012'>The “Niagara” honour is shared with but few other regiments.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment).</b>—[See
also the London Regiment, p. <a href='#Page_111'>111</a>]. Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The united Red and White Rose within the

the White Horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Namur, 1695; Martinique,

<p class='c000'>“The old eighteenth century colour, which now hangs
in the depot at Hounslow, was probably acquired by
the regiment about 1790.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was superseded by a set worked by the white
fingers of the English princesses themselves—a probably
unique honour. The Royal ladies were the sisters of the
Duke of Kent, then Colonel of the Royal Fusiliers.
Although exceedingly heavy and unwieldy, from being
overloaded with rich gold embroidery, these Colours
appear to have been carried for some time, and may have
been in the turmoil at Albuhera. But history is silent
on the subject of the colours of the 7th in the Peninsula
War, although the Fusiliers saw a lot of fighting, and
bear no fewer than nine honours on their Colours in
memory of the fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In 1829 a new set of Colours was presented to the
regiment by Lady Augusta Fitzclarence, while stationed
at Malta, after which the princesses’ Colours were given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to Lord Frederick Fitzclarence, not reverting to the
regiment until 50 or 60 years later, when one of the
Fitzclarence family kindly presented them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The 1829 set saw no active service, and were retired
in 1851, shortly before the Crimean War broke out,
and their remains placed in the garrison chapel at
Portsmouth. The King’s Colour has now practically
disappeared, and the other has more than half gone,
the three white horses and other decorations having
dropped off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The next set was also presented by Lady Augusta
Fitzclarence, and saw some stirring adventures in the
battle of the Alma, soon after the regiment landed to
begin its march into the interior. Both officers who
carried the colours fell on this occasion, as did also relief
after relief in their turn. At length one of the Colours—the
regimental—was dropped in the rear of a Russian
battery, and lay there while the Coldstream Guards
marched over it, without being aware of the fact—for
all eyes were fixed upon the enemy in front. It was
finally picked up by General Sir Percy Fielding, who
sent it back to the 7th.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In 1897 the second battalion of the regiment, the
1st Yorkshire Light Infantry, and the 2nd East Yorkshire
Regiment, participated in what was probably a
unique ceremony, all three battalions receiving their
new Colours at one and the same time from the hands of
the Duchess of York, now Queen Mary. The Duchess
was assisted by Lord Roberts, and the ceremony took
place at Phœnix Park, Dublin, in the presence of a vast
crowd.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

Fig. 26.</p>

<p class='c000'>Britannia was given as a badge to the “Fighting
Ninth” by Queen Anne, for the splendid work it did
at Almanza in 1707. Among the nicknames of this regiment
perhaps the best known is that of the “Holy Boys,”
an appellation given to it by the Spaniards in the Peninsula,
who took the device of Britannia to be that of the

<p class='c000'>“Although the West Yorkshires were raised so long
ago as 1685, their Colours had no honours for great early
battles until (a few years back) ‘Namur, 1695’ was
granted. ‘Corunna’ was the first name to be inscribed
thereon, and, although ‘Tournay’ was tardily authorised
in 1836, it was first placed on the stand issued to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the regiment in 1853. Thus the set issued in 1819 to
replace the tattered rags presented eighteen years before,
and which had time and again led the regiment on to
victory in Mauritius, in Java, and in Bengal—hard services
which wore the Colours out so rapidly that they
were described as being ‘fairly worn off the staves’
some years previously—bore only three honours, of
which the third, ‘Java,’ was won by the first battalion;
the second, ‘Waterloo,’ by the third battalion; and the
first, ‘Corunna,’ by the second battalion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The next honour to be gained by the 14th was
‘Bhurtpore,’ in 1820. Hardly had the great mine
beneath the hostile walls been sprung, when the besiegers
were seen rushing forward to the assault, the Colours of
the regiment beckoning in the very forefront, and being,
it is said, the first to be planted on the walls of the ‘impregnable’
Jat fortress. The 1835 set, therefore, which
replaced the ‘Bhurtpore’ Colours, had four names
emblazoned on them, and their successors five, ‘Tournay’
having by this time been added. These, the Crimean
Colours, under whose folds the additional honours of
‘Sevastopol’ and ‘New Zealand’ were earned, were not
formally ‘presented’ but simply given out on parade
without ceremony, according to instructions from the
War Office, which had been suddenly smitten with a
desire to save a pound or two here and there. They were
retired in 1876, and placed in Sandringham, by order of
His Majesty, then Prince of Wales, who had presented the
new set to the regiment at Lucknow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The campaign of 1879-80 in Afghanistan was the last
occasion upon which the West Yorkshires carried their
Colours into action, and that honour was, needless to say,

1762, 1794, 1809; Havannah; St. Lucia, 1778; Guadaloupe,
1810; Afghanistan, 1879-80; South Africa, 1900-02.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Snappers,” as this regiment is nicknamed, have
been in some of the fiercest contests fought by the British
Army, notably in the American War, at Blenheim, and
at Quebec, when General Wolfe was killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colours of the 4th battalion are shown in Fig. 33.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Bedfordshire Regiment.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The united Red and White Rose, placed below
the union wreath. The regimental number XVI. figures
in the space for the central badge. The flag is shown in
Fig. 29.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Namur, 1695; Blenheim; Ramillies;
Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Surinam; Chitral; South Africa,
1900-02. These distinctions are not arranged, as is usual, in
a circular order, but three are placed on either horizontal limb
of the St. George’s Cross and one on each of the vertical
limbs.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Leicestershire Regiment.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Royal Tiger, superscribed “Hindoostan,”
placed below the union wreath, a numeral figuring in
the space for the central badge.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>The battle honours are: Namur, 1695; Louisburg; Martinique,

Sevastopol; Ali Masjid; Afghanistan, 1878-79; Defence of
Ladysmith; South Africa, 1899-1902. These distinctions are not
arranged, as is usual, in a circular order, but upon the
horizontal and lower vertical limbs of the St. George’s Cross.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Royal Tiger was granted to the “Lily Whites”
for their splendid work in India during the early years
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Irish Regiment.</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Harp and Crown. In each of the four
corners, a shield with the arms of Nassau, and the motto,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virtutis Namurcencis Præmium</span>” (The reward of
virtue at Namur). The Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt.”
The Dragon, superscribed “China.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nassau arms, which formed part of the badges of
William of Orange, were bestowed upon the Royal Irish
in commemoration of the splendid way in which it
stormed the Castle of Namur in 1695, in the presence of
the King.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Namur, 1695; Blenheim; Ramillies;
Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Pegu; Sevastopol; New Zealand;
Afghanistan, 1879-80; Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir; Nile, 1884-85;
South Africa, 1900-02.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is well known that the bravery of this and other
Irish regiments in South Africa caused Queen Victoria
to raise the Irish Guards.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Alexandra, Princess of Wales’s Own (Yorkshire
Regiment).</b>—Facings, grass green.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Cypher of H.R.H. Alexandra, Princess of
Wales, in gold (thereon “Alexandra”), interlaced with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the Dannebrog, inscribed with the date 1875, and the
whole surmounted by the Coronet of the Princess.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dannebrog is the name given to the white cross
which the Danish king Waldemar was supposed to have
seen in the red sky on the night before he met the
Livonians in battle. His encounter was successful, and he
therefore looked upon the cross as a sign sent to him
from heaven. So deeply impressed was he by the apparition
that he straightway accepted it as a national symbol,
and it has been chosen as the badge of the “Green
Howards” owing to their patron being our honoured
Queen Mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Malplaquet; Alma; Inkerman;
Sevastopol; Tirah; South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Kimberley;
Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colours of the 4th battalion are shown in Fig. 31.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Lancashire Fusiliers.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt,” placed
below the union wreath, and, within the circular badge,
the Red Rose. The motto is “Omnia audax” (Daring
everything).</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Dettingen; Minden; Egmont-op-Zee;
Maida; Vimiera; Corunna; Vittoria; Pyrenees; Orthes; Toulouse;
Peninsula; Alma; Inkerman; Sevastopol; Lucknow;
Khartoum; South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colours of this regiment have been subjected to
more than ordinary vicissitudes. They were burnt in
order that they should not fall into the hands of the
enemy when forced to surrender at Saratoga; they were
lost during the retreat from Corunna, but happily found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>again on reaching Portsmouth, and in the Crimea they
were riddled by the Russian bullets.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Royal United Service Museum may be seen
one of the old colours, dating from the time when the
regiment was known as the 20th, or East Devonshires.
It is exhibit No. 3,084, and bears the inscription:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Portion of the Colours of the 20th Regiment, presented
to it in 1803 by Colonel Robert Ross, the hero of
Bladensburg; they were retired from service in 1815.
The 20th fought under them at the victory of Maida
in 1806, and they led the Regiment in the following
memorable battles of the Peninsula War: Vimiera,
Corunna, Vittoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelles, Orthes, and
Toulouse.”</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Scots Fusiliers.</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Thistle within the circle and motto of the
Order of the Thistle. In each of the four corners, the
Royal Cypher, ensigned with the imperial crown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The motto of this Order is “Nemo me impune lacessit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Blenheim; Ramillies; Oudenarde;
Malplaquet; Dettingen; Martinique, 1794; Bladensburg;
Alma; Inkerman; Sevastopol; South Africa, 1879; Burma,
1885-87; Tirah; South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colours of this regiment were captured by the
French at Blenheim during an overwhelming charge,
but were fortunately regained later. At New Orleans
they underwent an experience probably unparalleled
in the history of all regimental flags. A quartermaster-sergeant,
fearing that they might be lost, tore them
from their staff and wrapped them round his body.
Unfortunately, he was taken prisoner, but, strange as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>may seem, he was able to hide them from his guards
during the year or two that he was kept confined. The
faithful man was able to restore them to his regiment
when he regained England.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Cheshire Regiment.</b>—Facings, buff for all battalions
but the 4th, which are scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The united Red and White Rose.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Louisburg; Martinique, 1762; Havannah;
Meeanee; Hyderabad; Scinde; South Africa, 1900-02.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the battle of Dettingen which, curiously
enough, does not figure among the honorary distinctions,
King George II. was being harassed by the French when
a body of the “Two Twos” surrounded him, as he stood
under an oak tree, and protected his person. The King,
to show his gratitude, took a leaf from the tree, and
offered it to the senior officer. Ever since, the oak leaf
has been an honoured badge of the Cheshires, who wear
it on their colours annually on September 12th.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Welsh Fusiliers.</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The plume of the Prince of Wales. In the first
and fourth corners, the Rising Sun; in the second corner,
the Red Dragon; in the third corner, the White Horse,
with the motto, “Nec aspera terrent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The plume, the rising sun, and the dragon are badges
of the Prince of Wales. They were assigned to the old
23rd as a reward for its services in Marlborough’s campaign.
The red dragon is, of course, frequently associated
with Welsh, tradition.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Namur, 1695; Blenheim; Ramillies;
Oudenarde; Malplaquet; Dettingen; Minden; Corunna; Martinique,
1809; Albuhera; Badajoz; Salamanca; Vittoria; Pyrenees;
Nivelle; Orthes; Toulouse; Peninsula; Waterloo; Alma;
Inkerman; Sevastopol; Lucknow; Ashantee, 1873-4; Burma,
1885-87; South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Ladysmith;
Pekin, 1900.</p>

<p class='c000'>This regiment is the proud possessor of an unique
distinction—a silver wreath of immortelles, presented by
Queen Victoria—which it wears on the King’s colours in
memory of the gallantry displayed by Lieutenants
Melvill and Coghill, V.C. Mr. Philip A. Wilkins, in his
book, “The History of the Victoria Cross,” describes
the thrilling work of these two fine soldiers, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lieutenant Coghill had been told off to act as galloper
to Colonel Glyn on the unfortunate reconnaissance
made from Isandlwana Camp, on January 22nd, 1879,
but that officer, seeing he was quite lame, insisted that,
he should remain behind and nurse his knee, injured
while out foraging a few days before. He therefore
remained in the camp, which, as soon as the Zulus had
drawn off Lord Chelmsford and the main body of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>troops, was attacked by an impi of 25,000 men, completely
surrounded, and practically annihilated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Colonel Pulleine, who was in command, seeing the
desperate state of affairs, called to Lieutenant and
Adjutant Melvill to take the Queen’s (as it then was)
colour of the regiment and endeavour to cut his
way through the mass of Zulus, to prevent its falling
into the enemy’s hands. This order Lieutenant Melvill
proceeded to carry out, and, with Lieutenant Coghill,
spurred his horse over the rocky and dangerous ground
to the Buffalo River, six miles distant.... In company
with one mounted soldier, Melvill and Coghill
reached the Buffalo and plunged in, the soldier
being at once carried away by the whirling stream and
drowned. Coghill reached the Natal side in safety, and
turning round, saw Melvill, whose horse had been
drowned, being carried down by the rushing torrent,
and that the colour he had tried so hard to save
had been wrenched from his grasp, and was floating
away down the river. Though unable to walk owing to
his injured knee, and knowing, as he did, that any
accident to his horse meant certain death to him, with
safety and life at hand if he chose to take them, yet
Coghill refused to consider himself, and, turning his
horse’s head, rode back again into the stream to
Melvill’s assistance. The Zulus kept up a hot fire upon
both men, and shortly afterwards Coghill’s horse was
shot. With the greatest difficulty both managed to
reach and climb the steep bank, and took shelter
beneath some huge boulders....</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of their actual end no living man has ever borne
witness, but when a search party under Major Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>discovered the bodies of these brave men, a ring of dead
Zulus around them bore silent testimony that they had
sold their lives dearly, and had fought it out to the
last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Queen, whose colours these officers had died to
save, was quick to recognise such heroic bravery, and
sent two wreaths to be placed on the arms of the cross
which marks their grave by the Buffalo River, and later
presented to the 24th Regiment the silver wreath
mentioned above.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This act won for these gallant officers the Victoria
Cross and it brought about the decision that colours
should no more be carried into battle, as it caused valuable
lives to be lost in guarding them. This, then, was the
last occasion when these cherished emblems were taken
into the array of battle.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The King’s Own Scottish Borderers.</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Castle of Edinburgh, where the regiment
was originally raised by the Earl of Leven in 1689. The
motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nisi Dominus frustra</span>” (Without the Lord, it
is useless). In the first and fourth corners, the Royal
Crest, with the motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In veritate religionis confido</span>”
(In the truth of religion I confide). In the second and
third corners, the White Horse, with “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec aspera

the union wreath.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Namur, 1695; Minden; Egmont-op-Zee;

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><b>The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Castle of Inniskilling with three turrets,
and a St. George’s flag flying from one of them. In
each of the four corners the White Horse, with the

<p class='c000'><b>The Gloucestershire Regiment.</b>—Facings, white,
except for the 5th battalion, which are scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—No regimental badge figures within the central

(No colour bears a longer list of honours than those of this regiment)</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Worcestershire Regiment.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The united Red and White Rose with the motto,
“Firm,” in the lower vertical limb of the red St. George’s
Cross. A Naval Crown, superscribed “1st June, 1794,”
in the upper vertical limb.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Ramillies; Mysore; Hindoostan;

<p class='c000'><b>The East Lancashire Regiment.</b>—Facings, white,
for all battalions except the 5th, which are black.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt,” placed
below the union wreath. The motto, “Spectamur
agendo” (By our actions, let us be judged).</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Gibraltar, 1704-5; Cape of

<p class='c000'><b>The East Surrey Regiment.</b>—Facings, white, except
for the 6th battalion, which are scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The united Red and White Rose, placed beneath
the union wreath.</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Gibraltar, 1704-5; Dettingen;
Martinique, 1794; Guadaloupe, 1810; Talavera; Albuhera;

1842; Moodkee; Ferozeshah; Aliwal; Sobraon; Sevastopol;

1885; South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Strafford’s coat of arms includes a small representation
of the colours of this regiment. He was
permitted to use this device in recognition of his services
at St. Pierre. In the heat of the fighting, Strafford, who
was then Sir John Byng, snatched up the colours and
carried them forward in a charge. His gallant action
had a very fine influence on the men, and this privilege
of using a representation of the colours in his arms must
be one of which the family of Strafford are rightly proud.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><b>The Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry.</b>—Facings,
white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The united Red and White Rose, placed below
the union wreath. This flag is shown in Fig. 28.</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Gibraltar, 1704-05; Dettingen;
St. Lucia, 1778; Dominica; Roliça; Vimiera; Corunna; Salamanca;
Pyrenees; Nivelle; Nive; Orthes; Peninsula; Waterloo;
Punjaub; Mooltan; Goojerat; Sevastopol; Lucknow; Egypt, 1882;
Tel-el-Kebir; Nile, 1884-85; South Africa, 1899-1902; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flag of the “Docs” must not be confused with
that of the East Surreys, to which it bears a very close
resemblance. The colour reveals little that is distinctive,
and it seems a pity, somewhat, that a regiment with
such a fine record at Lucknow, Cawnpore, and elsewhere
should not possess devices of more interest. Its motto,
“One and All,” which, however, does not figure on the
flag, is, we believe, unrecognised by the authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Duke of Wellington’s (West Riding Regiment).</b>—Facings,
scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The late Duke of Wellington’s crest, with the
motto in an escroll above, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virtutis fortuna comes</span>”
(Fortune, the friend of pluck). The Elephant, superscribed
“Hindoostan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duke’s crest consists of a three-quarter length
rampant lion emerging from a crown and grasping in
its fore-paws a flag bearing the cross of St. George.</p>

<p class='c000'>The elephant with a howdah is obviously a badge
gained for services in India.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Dettingen; Mysore; Seringapatam;
Ally Ghur; Delhi, 1803; Leswarree; Deig; Corunna; Nive;
Peninsula; Waterloo; Alma; Inkerman; Sevastopol; Abyssinia;
South Africa, 1900-02; Relief of Kimberley; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>This regiment, the only one named after a person not
of royal blood, had a “battalion in the Bergen-op-Zoom
disaster, but before the English, who had managed to
get within the fort, were compelled to surrender, the
Colour-bearers of the regiment were sent back over the
walls with instructions to save the Colours as best they
could. They were successful; in fact, not one Colour
has ever been lost by this famous corps in battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“New Colours were presented in 1813, and these were
carried at the battle of Waterloo two years later. The
33rd formed part of Halkett’s Brigade, which occupied
the centre of the line, and was almost crumpled to pieces
by the efforts of Napoleon’s massed guns. These Colours
continued to be carried until 1830, when they were reported
upon at Spanish Town as ‘very old, and
scarcely to be distinguished as Colours.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ‘Havercake Lads’ were present, as was only fit,
at the funeral of the great Duke after whom they were
named, in 1852, and the regimental Colour carried on
that occasion underwent rather a curious adventure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When the Colours were brought from Glasgow to
London for the ceremony, they were left in the house of
Colonel Blake, of the regiment, in Portland Place, for a
while. Now, although this particular set had never been
in battle, they were in ribbons as the result of much bad
weather in various climes, and their tattered condition
struck pity to the feminine heart of Mrs. Colonel Blake.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Men are so careless,’ she said to herself; ‘fancy
letting them get into that state! I’ll mend the Colours
for them.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The regimental Colour being white with a red cross,
Mrs. Blake’s white silk wedding dress was just the thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>for repairs—and for repairs accordingly it was used,
and the offending Colour was nicely patched, to the consternation
of the regiment when they saw it. But out
of consideration for the lady’s feelings, the patches were
never removed, and can still be seen quite plainly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This set was retired at Dublin in 1854, and taken
possession of by the commanding officer. His widow afterwards
presented both Colours to the Royal United
Service Institute, in which museum in Whitehall, they
hang to this day.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The exhibit bears the following inscription: Colours
of the 33rd Regiment, 1832-54, then known as the 1st
Yorkshire (West Riding), which were presented to the
battalion in 1832, at Weedon, by General Sir Charles
Whale, K.C.B., colonel of the regiment. The first is the
ordinary Royal colour of the great Union; and the
second, or regimental colour, the Red Cross of St. George
on a white field, and only two honours are attached,
those of “Peninsula” and “Seringapatam.” They
have never been on active service, but they are associated
with two interesting military events. From 1838 to
1840 the 33rd were at Gibraltar, and there under these
colours H.R.H. the late Commander-in-Chief, then
Prince George of Cambridge, was attached for duty to
the battalion on his first introduction to the British Army.
The 33rd, as is well known, monopolised most of the regimental
service of the great Duke of Wellington, and at
his funeral on the 18th November, 1852—to attend which
the regiment was brought to London from Glasgow—these
colours proved a conspicuous mark. The colours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>were retired from service at Dublin in 1851, prior to the
33rd proceeding to the Crimea.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Border Regiment.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—A laurel wreath. The Dragon, superscribed
“China.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This regiment is a combination of the old 34th Cumberland
and the 55th Westmoreland; it now possesses
the former’s laurel wreath, gained for admirable services
rendered on the fatal held of Fontenoy, and the latter’s
dragon, awarded in recognition of its work in China, 1842.</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Havannah; St. Lucia, 1778;
Albuhera; Arroyo dos Molinos; Vittoria; Pyrenees; Nivelle;
Nive; Orthes; Peninsula; Alma; Inkerman; Sevastopol;
Lucknow; South Africa, 1899-1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c000'>This regiment is the only one with “Arroyo dos
Molinos” as a battle honour. In the Peninsula, by a
surprise move, the old 34th took prisoners almost all of
the 34th regiment of French Infantry. As a reward,
they were allowed to wear a red and white ball in the
front of their shakos. When, later, this appointment
became general among infantry regiments, the Borders
showed their displeasure at losing this distinctive sign.
By way of compensation, the battle honour of “Arroyo
dos Molinos” was granted to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The colours which were carried in this fight became
so tattered and dilapidated in after years that the officers
at length decided to have them preserved under glass
in order to lengthen their existence, and they were sent,
accordingly, to a tradesman in the Opera Colonnade,
London. While in his keeping, however, the building
was, unfortunately, burnt to the ground, and the charred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>remains of the colours were all that was ever recovered
from the ruins. Even these were thought worthy of
preservation, and now rest confined in a silver urn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The colours which replaced the Bergen set in 1815
passed through strange vicissitudes before Lord Archibald
Campbell at last rescued them in 1888. His attention
was drawn to them by a pawnbroker’s advertisement
which offered them for sale as though they had been a
pair of mere window curtains. Needless to say, they
were at once purchased, and are now safe with the other
old colours of this historic regiment at Kendal.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Sussex Regiment.</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The White Rousillon plume which it gained
on the Heights of Abraham, when it overcame Montcalm’s
Rousillon regiment. This latter force possessed
the device of a white plume or feather, and the Royal
Sussex adopted it as their badge.</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Gibraltar, 1704-05; Louisburg;
Quebec, 1759; Martinique, 1762; Havannah; St. Louis, 1778;

<p class='c000'>The 7th battalion carries colours with the following
devices: A Stirrup. In the first and fourth corners, a
White Rose, and in the second and third, a Red Rose.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The South Staffordshire Regiment.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt,” placed

<p class='c000'><b>The Dorsetshire Regiment.</b>—Facings, grass green.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primus in Indus</span>” (First in India),
because it was the first regiment from the home country
to be landed in India. Also, the Castle and Key, superscribed
“Gibraltar, 1779-83,” and the motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Montis

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Plassey; Martinique, 1794; Marabout;
Albuhera; Vittoria; Pyrenees; Nivelle; Nive; Orthes; Peninsula;
Ava; Maharajpore; Sevastopol; Tirah; South Africa,
1899-1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colours of the 54th or West Norfolk, now forming
the second battalion of the Dorsetshires, were on board
the “Sarah Sands,” when this vessel, laden with vast
stores of ammunition, caught fire. When the alarm was
given, the room in which these emblems were placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>was full of smoke, and they were only rescued after an
heroic attempt on the part of Private Wiles and the
Quartermaster. These colours may now be seen in
Norwich Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Prince of Wales’s Volunteers (South Lancashire
Regiment).</b>—Facings, white for all battalions but
the 5th, which are scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>A set of retired colours belonging to this regiment may
be seen in Chelsea Hospital. The exhibit bears the following
inscription:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Colours of the 40th Regiment. Presented to
Sir Alexander Woodford (for many years Colonel of that
gallant Regiment), by Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie and the
officers of the Corps, on its return from service in New
Zealand, and delivered into his hands by Colonel A.
Nelson, at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, 1867.”</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Welsh Regiment.</b>—Facings, white for all
battalions but the 7th (Cyclist) battalion, which are
scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Rose and Thistle on the same stalk, within
the Garter. In the first and fourth corners, the Royal

motto, “<span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Gwell angau na chywilydd</span>” (Death rather
than shame). A naval crown, superscribed “12th
April, 1782.” (This device serves to recall the defeat of
De Grasse by Rodney at Martinique.)</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Martinique, 1762; St. Vincent; Bourbon;

<p class='c000'>“The second battalion has been rather unfortunate
with its colours, losing one at Bergen-op-Zoom—it was
afterwards taken to Paris—and the other at Quatre Bras.
This was taken by the (French) 8th Hussars, who charged
the regiment through the long corn just as the Prince of
Orange was interfering with its formation. It was not lost
without a splendid fight, however, Clarke, who carried it,
receiving no fewer than twenty-three wounds and losing
the use of an arm in its defence.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> A fragment of an
old colour of the 41st is exhibited in the Royal United

<p class='c000'>The “Light Bobs,” as this regiment is nicknamed, are
a combination of the old 43rd (Monmouthshire Light
Infantry) and the 52nd (Oxfordshire Light Infantry).
A retired stand of flags of the former may be seen in the
Royal United Service Museum, bearing this inscription:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Colours of the 43rd, 1818-27, one of the regiments of
the celebrated Light Division of Peninsula fame. The
first or Royal colour is the Great Union, and the second,
or regimental colour, the Red Cross of St. George on the
white field. They only bear the one distinction, ‘Peninsula,’
the other honours shortly afterwards authorised
not having been added. They were made to replace
those carried with such distinguished honour in the
Peninsula, and were presented to the regiment in 1818
at Valenciennes. The colours were carried on parade
at the celebrated review held on 23rd October, 1818,
the day before the break-up of the Army, when the
whole of the British, Hanoverian, Saxon, and Danish
contingents, commanded by the Duke of Wellington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>were paraded before the Emperor of Russia and King of
Prussia, near Valenciennes. Their last public act was
to accompany the regiment to the Peninsula in 1827,
when five thousand British troops were despatched
under General Sir Henry Clinton, owing to the disturbed
state of Portugal, and the hostile attitude of Spain. A
few months later the colours were retired from service,
when a new set bearing the eleven additional honours
authorised in 1821 were presented by the wife of
the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel William
Haverfield.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another stand of colours, in the same museum, represent
the old 52nd regiment. Here is the record
exhibited with them:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Colours of the 52nd Light Infantry, 1824-52, now the
2nd Battalion of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry, and they
appropriately hang next those of their linked battalion
and old Peninsula comrades, the 43rd. The Royal or
King’s colour is the Great Union, and is so dilapidated,
that it can scarcely hold the honours attached to it.
The regimental colour, which is in much better condition,
is of buff silk, and bears fifteen honours—the largest
number granted at the time to any corps, save one, the
Rifle Brigade. They were presented to the regiment at
St. John’s, New Brunswick, in 1823, to replace the colours
which the 52nd had so nobly borne in the Peninsula
and Waterloo. In that great struggle, the 52nd were
commanded by the celebrated Lieutenant-Colonel John
Colborne, afterwards Lord Seaton, he whom Napier
justly described as ‘a man of singular talents for war,
and capable of turning the fate of a battle.’ This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>distinguished soldier, who had so often led the regiment
to victory and never hurried it into defeat, commanded
the 52nd when these colours were taken into use in 1824.
They have never faced a foreign foe, but they were
silent witnesses of the steady discipline and bravery of
the regiment on board the transport ‘Marquis of
Huntly,’ which was nearly lost in a hurricane in the
Atlantic in 1831.”</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Essex Regiment.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Castle and Key, superscribed “Gibraltar,
1779-83,” with the motto, “Montis Insignia Calpe”
underneath. The Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt.” An
Eagle. (This latter device is borne to recall the Eagle
captured by the 44th [Essex] from the 62nd French
regiment at Salamanca. The French Eagle is now in
Chelsea Hospital).</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Havannah; Moro; Badajoz; Salamanca;
Peninsula; Bladensburg; Waterloo; Ava; Alma; Inkerman;
Sevastopol; Taku Forts; Nile, 1884-85; South Africa,
1899-1902; Relief of Kimberley; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the headquarters of this regiment is preserved a
small piece of soiled rag which the casual observer might
consider of small value. But it is the corner of an old
colour which possesses the following interesting history.
At Quatre Bras, a French Lancer gallantly charged at
the colours of the old 44th, and severely wounded Ensign
Christie, who carried one of them. The Frenchman then
endeavoured to seize the standard, but the brave Christie,
with a presence of mind almost unequalled, flung himself
upon it. As the colours fluttered in the fall, the Frenchman
tore off a portion of the gay-coloured fabric with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>point of his lance, but he was not permitted to carry the
precious fragment far away, for he was shot. It is this
piece, which was carefully preserved, that now reposes
at Warley.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and
Derbyshire Regiment).</b>—Facings, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,

<p class='c000'>An old set of colours belonging to the 2nd battalion
are exhibited in the Royal United Service Museum.
“They have a peculiar history attached to them. The
2nd battalion of this regiment, with the 2nd battalion
48th, the Buffs, and 31st, were in Colborne’s brigade at
Albuhera, which was nearly destroyed. The loss of the
four battalions amounted to 1,413, of which the Berkshires
reached 272, and so weak had they become that
it was found necessary to form them into provisional
battalions, when the 66th (Berkshire) and the 31st
were formed into a unit commanded by Colonel Leith,
of the 31st. It was necessary to supply the 66th with
new colours after the war. They duly arrived early in
1812, but were not taken into use because the colours of
the 31st, as the senior regiment, were carried by the
provisional battalion. They were, therefore, sent home,
and when the regiment arrived in England in the summer
of 1814, were sent to Plymouth to meet the battalion.
But they were lost, never reached their destination, and
it was necessary to make another set for the battalion.
Not long afterwards, they turned up again, but too late
to be taken into use. They came into the possession of
the commanding officer, and were presented to the
Royal United Service Museum.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The regiment, with its colours, nearly suffered disaster
when on board the “Alert,” which was wrecked off
Halifax, Nova Scotia. The men fell in on the lower
deck, and awaited their fate, but, almost by a miracle,
the vessel was brought into port and all were saved.
The Duke of Wellington paid a high compliment to this
gallant regiment, by decreeing that an account of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>disaster and its happy sequel should be read to all the
units of the Army.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The York and Lancaster Regiment.</b>—Facings, white.</p>

Persia; Reshire; Bushire; Koosh-ab; New Zealand; South

strong in Indian honours, due to the fact that the 2nd battalion
was raised by the East India Company under the name of the
2nd Bombay European Light Infantry.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Highland Light Infantry.</b>—Facings, buff for all

<p class='c000'>“When the 71st (now the 1st Battalion Highland
Light Infantry) left England for the Peninsula War,
Brigadier-General Pack ordered their Colours to be left
behind in the Tower of London, and the regiment accordingly
fought without any throughout the arduous Spanish
campaigns. Pack’s reason for leaving the Colours behind
is not quite clear, but if he thought they would be safer
at home than on the field of battle he was woefully
mistaken. In 1814, soon after the close of the war in
question, the Prince Regent entertained the Allied
Sovereigns to a grand dinner in Carlton House, and
among the table decorations on that occasion were the
Colours of the 71st, which were brought from the Tower
for the purpose. To debase such sacred emblems as
Colours to such a use was bad enough, but worse was to
follow, for after the banquet, the Colours disappeared,
and were never seen again. They may turn up yet;
stranger things have happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This was the stand which had been presented to
the regiment by General Floyd to replace that which had
been lost during the unfortunate expedition to Buenos
Ayres, when the 71st, after being reduced to a mere handful
by the bullets of the Spaniards, were compelled to
surrender as prisoners of war. A piper’s banner, which
was lost on the same occasion, has since been restored
to the regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The 71st took part in the ill-starred Walcheren
expedition, but they do not seem to have had their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Colours with them on this occasion, for when they landed
and took possession of a flagstaff, a soldier’s red jacket
was hoisted in lieu of a proper flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In 1841 the Duke of Wellington did this regiment
the honour of presenting it with new Colours at Windsor,
the ceremony taking place in the presence of the Queen,
Prince Consort, and the King of Prussia. In 1857 Colours
were received from the hands of the Duke of Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The former 74th, now the 2nd Battalion Highland
Light Infantry, was one of the corps which was granted
a third Colour for bravery at Assaye. This banner—which
was white, bearing the elephant and ‘LXXIV.’
within a wreath, and inscribed with the victories of Assaye
and Seringapatam—was referred to by an inspecting
officer in 1830 as ‘a very honourable, but useless,
appendage, and takes one officer to carry it, who would be
much better with his company,’ and the same year it
was ordered to be abandoned by the regiment, except on
gala days, reviews, etc.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><b>Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, the Duke
of Albany’s).</b>—Facings, buff, except for the 5th
(Sutherland and Caithness Highland Battalion), which
are yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—In each of the four corners the late Duke of
York’s cypher and coronet (i.e., Frederick, at one time
Duke of Albany). The motto, “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Cuidich’n Righ</span>” (Help
the King), was given to the Mackenzie as a reward
for protecting Alexander II. when attacked by a wounded
stag. Also the Elephant, superscribed “Assaye.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The battle honours are: Carnatic; Mysore; Hindoostan;
Cape of Good Hope, 1806; Maida; Java; South Africa, 1835;
Sevastopol; Persia; Koosh-ab; Lucknow; Central India;
Peiwar Kotal; Charasiah; Kabul, 1879; Kandahar, 1880;
Afghanistan, 1878–80; Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir; Chitral;
Atbara; Khartoum; South Africa, 1899–1902; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c000'>This regiment was awarded a third colour by the East
India Company for services at Assaye (see Highland
Light Infantry). It was made of white silk and bore the
word “Assaye” above a representation of an elephant,
the whole surrounded by a laurel wreath. The regimental
number figured prominently on this banner, which is
often called the “Elephant colour.” The colour was
lost, and its history after about the year 1810 is
unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Gordon Highlanders.</b>—Facings, yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt”; also the
Royal Tiger, superscribed “India.” (One in each of the
lower corners.)</p>

<p class='c012'>The many battle honours are: Mysore; Seringapatam; Egmont-op-Zee;
Mandora; Corunna; Fuentes d’Onor; Almaraz;
Vittoria; Pyrenees; Nive; Orthes; Peninsula; Waterloo;
South Africa, 1835; Delhi, 1857; Lucknow; Charasiah; Kabul,
1879; Kandahar, 1880; Afghanistan, 1878–80; Egypt, 1882,
1884; Tel-el-Kebir; Nile, 1884–85; Chitral; Tirah; South
Africa, 1899–1902; Defence of Ladysmith; Paardeberg.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Regiment,” in its issue of October 28th, 1916,
gives the following interesting account of the Gordons’
colours:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“One Colour of the original set presented to the
gallant 92nd on its formation in 1794 has disappeared,
but its companion, the regimental Colour, is not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>still in existence, but is even in a good state of preservation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This set went through the Holland campaign in 1799,
and there is good reason to suppose that the King’s
Colour got very badly knocked about in the fighting on
that occasion. At any rate, when the union of Great
Britain and Ireland took place in 1801, it was replaced
by a new Colour, notwithstanding the small number of
years it had been in use. The regimental Colour, on the
other hand, was merely altered so as to bring it into line
with the new pattern as sealed by the authorities. The
original number of the regiment—100—had already,
in 1798, been changed to 92, and the fresh alterations
consisted chiefly of shamrock leaves, which were added
to the existing wreath of roses and thistles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only active service which this very much adapted
set of Colours ever saw was in Egypt in the following
year. By their valour at Alexandria, Mandora, and other
fights, the Gordons won the right to bear the Sphinx on
their Colours, and the badge was placed on all four
corners of the regimental one—a very rare thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In 1807 the Colours were retired, and reverted, as
usual, to the colonel of the regiment, the Duke of
Richmond and Gordon, who placed them in his residence
of Gordon Castle. In order the better to preserve them,
they have since been enclosed in a glass case, and both
are in remarkably good condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Their successors had a much more stirring career.
In 1807 they led the Gordons on at Copenhagen. Next
they accompanied them on their retreat to Corunna,
and at the battle itself, Colonel Alexander Napier fell
beneath their folds. When the regiment effected its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>landing at Walcheren later on in the same year we read
that the Colours were carried uncased and upright in
the centre boat of the flotilla.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not long afterwards they were sent back to the
Peninsula, and the Colours were carried throughout the
war from Fuentes d’Onor onwards. At Maya, one of
the battles of the Pyrenees, the Colours fell to the ground
time after time, every officer but two being either killed
or wounded, and carried from the field. At St. Pierre
the Gordons again advanced with Colours flying and pipes
skirling, and drove the enemy from his positions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The last battle in which they were carried was
Waterloo.”</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders.</b>—Facings,
blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Thistle ensigned with the imperial crown.
The Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The honorary distinctions are: Egmont-op-Zee; Corunna;
Busaco; Fuentes d’Onor; Salamanca; Pyrenees; Nivelle;
Nive; Toulouse; Peninsula; Waterloo; Alma; Sevastopol;
Lucknow; Egypt, 1882; Tel-el-Kebir; Nile, 1884–85; Atbara;
Khartoum; South Africa, 1900–02.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Irish Rifles.</b>—Rifle regiments do not
possess colours.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Princess Victoria’s (Royal Irish Fusiliers).</b>—Facings,
blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Princess Victoria, who gave her name to this
regiment, was afterwards Queen Victoria.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Plume of the Prince of Wales. In the first
and fourth corners, Princess Victoria’s coronet; in the
second, an Eagle, with a wreath of laurel (to commemorate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the one captured from the French at Barrosa); in the
third, the Harp and Crown; the Sphinx, superscribed
“Egypt.” The motto, “Faugh-a-Ballagh.” (Clear the
way.)</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Monte Video; Talavera; Barrosa;
Tarifa; Java; Vittoria; Nivelle; Niagara; Orthes; Toulouse;
Peninsula; Ava; Sevastopol; Egypt, 1882–1884; Tel-el-Kebir;
South Africa, 1899–1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Connaught Rangers.</b>—Facings, green.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Harp and Crown, with the motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quis
separabit</span>” (Who shall separate?) The Elephant, the
Sphinx, superscribed “Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Seringapatam; Talavera; Busaco;
Fuentes d’Onor; Ciudad Rodrigo; Badajoz; Salamanca; Vittoria;
Pyrenees; Nivelle; Orthes; Toulouse; Peninsula; Alma;
Inkerman; Sevastopol; Central India; South Africa, 1877–8–9;
South Africa, 1899–1902; Relief of Ladysmith.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Princess Louise’s (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders).</b>—Facings,
yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—A Boar’s Head, with the motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne obliviscaris</span>”
(Do not forget), within a wreath of myrtle. A
Cat with the motto, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sans Peur</span>” (Without fear),
within a wreath of broom. Over all, the label as represented
in the arms of the Princess Louise, and surmounted
with Her Royal Highness’s coronet. In each
of the four corners, Princess Louise’s cypher and coronet.</p>

<p class='c000'>This description seems somewhat involved, but the
flag itself in no wise furthers this idea. The badge, which
is placed in the centre of the flag, consists of a boar’s
head, to represent the house of Campbell, and a cat,
seated, to represent the house of Sutherland. The label,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>spoken of above, is merely a white bar, having three
points projecting from it, downwards, one at each end
and one in the middle. This bar is a sign of royalty,
which figures in most of the royal arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Cape of Good Hope, 1806; Roliça;
Vimiera; Corunna; Pyrenees; Nivelle; Nive; Orthes; Toulouse;
Peninsula; Alma; Balaklava; Sevastopol; Lucknow; South
Africa, 1846–7, 1851–2–3, 1879; South Africa, 1899–1902; Modder
River; Paardeberg. No other infantry regiment bears an honour
for Balaklava.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two old colours of this regiment are worth mentioning;
one was burnt while reposing in Inverary Castle, where
it had been placed by the Duke of Argyll; the other
was used to enshroud the body, before burial, of a
lieutenant who was killed at New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment (Royal
Canadians).</b>—Facings, blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R.C.—The Plume of the Prince of Wales, as the central
badge. In each of the four corners, a maple leaf.</p>

<p class='c012'>The battle honours are: Niagara; Central India; South Africa,
1900–02. They are arranged one on each side and one below the
union wreath.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first battalion of this regiment is of Canadian
origin, whilst the 2nd battalion was raised in India.
At a time when such valuable assistance has been proffered
to the Empire by the Colonies, it is pleasant to recall
that the Royal Canadians were the very first unit ever
to come to the assistance of the Motherland; this it
did during the Indian Mutiny.</p>

<p class='c000'>A King’s colour of the 2nd battalion is exhibited in
the Royal United Service Museum. “It forms one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>a pair which was presented to the regiment at Aden on
the 23rd January, 1866, by Mrs. Raines, wife of General
Raines, C.B., who commanded the garrison. They were
the first colours presented to the regiment as a British
regiment, it having been before that time the Third
Bombay European Regiment. The colours were used
until 2nd April, 1906, when they were replaced by a
new pair at Mauritius, the presentation being made by
the Governor of the Island.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—For reasons which every reader will appreciate
the Army Authorities have ceased to make public the
changes which the war has entailed in the numbering
of battalions. On this account we have deemed it
advisable to follow the regimental records as published
in the Spring of 1914.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>COLOURS OF OUR OVERSEAS DOMINIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is unnecessary here to speak of the splendid work
performed by the overseas regiments in combating the
war lust of the Central European Powers, for the fame
of these gallant bodies of men is now world-wide. Many
of the units of our far-flung Empire which in 1914 were
unborn or unknown in the Mother Country are as household
words to us now, and we reckon them as much a
part of the British Army as we do the Buffs or the Black
Watch. Thus it is imperative in a work of this nature
to write of the colours of our overseas as well as our
home regiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Army of the Indian Empire, many units of which
came into such prominence in the early part of the
War, possesses a very fine array of regimental flags. In
the main these emblems follow the rules as we have
given them when dealing with the home forces. Each
regimental colour, for instance, bears a central crimson
badge bearing an appropriate device, number or title,
and the whole is surmounted by the usual imperial
crown. Surrounding this is the regulation union wreath
composed of roses, thistles and shamrocks, whilst honorary
distinctions are arranged upon a circular laurel wreath,
or, when few in number, on either side of the union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>sprays. The ground colour of these flags is controlled
by the regimental facings in exactly the same way as
they are at home. Also, it may be said that the King’s
colours are Union flags, each with a central crimson
badge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the regimental flags bear no distinctive device
but a few display a motto. The following possess one
or other of these features:</p>

<p class='c000'><b>2nd Queen Victoria’s Own Rajput Light Infantry.</b>—Facings,
blue. The Royal and Imperial Cypher of
Queen Victoria within the Garter as central badge.
Fourteen battle honours are given upon an outer laurel
wreath.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>7th Duke of Connaught’s Own Rajputs.</b>—Facings,
yellow. The Duke of Connaught’s Crest and Cypher.
Eight battle honours.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>12th Pioneers (the Kelat-i-Ghilzie Regiment).</b>—This
unit carries a special regimental colour, the
groundwork of which is red, yellow and blue in three
horizontal bars. A mural crown superscribed “Invicta,”
and the names of eight battle honours appear on this
flag. (Fig. 43).</p>

<p class='c000'><b>14th King George’s Own Ferozepore Sikhs.</b>—Facings,
yellow. The Plume of the Prince of Wales
appears in the central badge and the Royal and Imperial
Cypher is given in each of the four comers. There
are five battle honours.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>16th Rajputs (the Lucknow Regiment).</b>—Facings,
white. There are three battle honours, of which one,
“Lucknow,” is placed above a turreted gateway.</p>

battle honours are given.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>61st King George’s Own Pioneers.</b>—Facings, white.
The Plume of the Prince of Wales in the centre and the
Royal and Imperial Cypher in each of the four corners.
Eleven battle honours appear.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>62nd Punjabis.</b>—Facings, emerald green. An

(Fig. 44).</p>

<p class='c000'><b>63rd Palamcottah Light Infantry.</b>—Facings, emerald

distinctions.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>64th Pioneers.</b>—Facings, white. The central badge
bears a numeral, but the elephant of India is given below
the union wreath. Five distinctions appear.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>66th Punjabis.</b>—Facings, emerald green. A golden
dragon, wearing an Imperial Crown, and six battle honours
are depicted on these colours.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>69th Punjabis.</b>—Facings, emerald green. A galley
with the motto, in Persian characters, signifying “By
Sea and Land,” and five honours ornament these
colours.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>74th Punjabis.</b>—Facings, emerald green. On this
flag appears a dragon with the motto, in Persian, “Ready
and True,” and six battle honours.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span><b>83rd Wallajahbad Light Infantry.</b>—Facings, emerald

<p class='c000'><b>101st Grenadiers.</b>—Facings, white. The White Horse
appears in the central circle and two honours are given
on the three lowest limbs of the St. George’s Cross.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>102nd King Edward’s Own Grenadiers.</b>—Facings,
white. The Plume of the Prince of Wales, the Sphinx,
the Royal and Imperial Cypher of King Edward VII.,
and four battle honours are the special features of this
flag.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>113th Infantry.</b>—Facings, yellow. The Sphinx
appears below the central badge. Five honours are
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>121st Pioneers.</b>—Crossed axes and seven honorary
distinctions are given on a white flag bearing the red
St. George’s Cross.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>127th Queen Mary’s Own Baluch Light Infantry.</b>—Facings,
scarlet. In each of the four corners of these
colours appears the Cypher of Her Majesty the Queen.
Five battle honours.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>128th Pioneers.</b>—Facings, white. The motto,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Progredior</span>,” and six honours are the special features
of this flag.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><b>The Canadian Military Colours</b> are also planned
on the lines set down for those of the Mother Country.
The King’s colours are Union flags with central badges
and the regimental colours depend for their hue upon
the facings of the uniforms. The union wreaths, however,
are not always of the strict standard pattern, though
they vary but slightly; also, Arabic numerals are often
used instead of Roman numerals to give the regimental
number. In a few cases, a complete departure has been
made from the regulation pattern in the case of certain
regimental colours. Instead of the union wreath, a
large and beautiful maple leaf is spread across the flag,
and placed upon it centrally is a badge bearing the usual
particulars.</p>

<p class='c000'>[Further details of the Canadian military colours are
given in an appendix at the end of this book.]</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately, there are no colours to record of the
<b>Australian Imperial Force</b>, as none of the units
are in possession of these emblems.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The West India Regiment</b> is placed in the Army
List almost following on the London Regiment (Territorial
Force). The facings are white and, consequently,
the regimental colours are white with the red cross of
St. George. The design follows the standard pattern
of the home infantry, and the battle honours, which
testify to splendid services in various parts of the world,
are: Dominica; Martinique, 1809; Guadaloupe, 1810;
Ashantee; West Africa, 1887, 1892–3–4; Sierra Leone,
1898. The Dominica and Sierra Leone honours refer
to the French attack between 1778 and 1805. (Fig. 47).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span><b>The King’s Own Malta Regiment of Militia.</b>—This
regiment possesses a King’s colour of usual type,
and a regimental colour of blue material, with a central
badge bearing the Royal Cypher, surrounded by the
standard union wreath and surmounted by the imperial
crown. A Maltese Cross is placed in each of the four
corners. A battle honour, “MDCCC,” refers to the
French surrender of the island to the British on
September 5th, 1800.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>MISCELLANEOUS COLOURS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Many interesting colours do not permit of classification
in any of the foregoing groups and must be described
in the present chapter. The order of Army sequence
cannot, of course, be preserved in their case.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Honourable Artillery Company</b>, which figures
in the Army List directly after the Royal Garrison
Artillery and immediately before the Royal Artillery
(Territorial Force), is probably one of the most interesting
units of the Army. It was first formed “about the year
1807, in the reign of William II., as a society of armed
citizens for the protection of the goods of merchants,
which were frequently commandeered by persons who
had no respect for the property of others. The date of
the incorporation of the Company is, however, 1537,
when a Royal Charter was granted by Henry VIII.,
under the title of the Guild of Fraternity of St. George.
This Charter gave power to the members to elect others
to serve in the ranks, and to appoint masters or officers;
to use a common seal; to make laws for the rule of the
Fraternity; granted license to use and shoot with longbows,
cross-bows, and hand-guns throughout the realm,
including Calais; gave power to license all guilds of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>like nature throughout the Kingdom; and ordained that
the masters or rulers should be exempt from being empanelled
on any quest or jury throughout the realm.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
The regimental colour of the H.A.C. is shown in Fig. 39,
and, it is interesting to add, two retired flags may be
seen in St. Botolph Church, Bishopsgate.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Marine Light Infantry</b> has a very
fine blue regimental colour. The Globe forms the central
badge, and this is surrounded by a green laurel wreath
with the imperial crown above. Placed between the
crown and the Globe is an anchor ornamented with the
Royal Cypher. In the dexter canton is a small Union
flag, whilst the Royal Cypher figures in the remaining
three. The motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per Mare, Per Terram</span>,” which
testifies to the world-wide influence of this fighting force,
and the battle honour, “Gibraltar,” figure on two
golden scrolls. The honour is also inscribed on the King’s
colour. (Fig. 45).</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey</b> has an
artillery section and three battalions of light infantry.
The latter have colours, the 1st and 3rd battalions
of which are identical except for the necessary
difference of wording. In both cases the material
is blue and the central badge consists of the three lions
of England. The union wreath and the imperial crown
appear as on the home infantry colours. The battle
honour, “Jersey, 1781,” refers to the French attack
organised by Baron de Rullecour, and successfully met
by this regiment under the command of Major Pierson.
A small Union flag is shown in the dexter canton.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>The colour of the second battalion varies but slightly
from the others. The badge is a shield and not circular,
a horn with the figure “2” is placed above the badge,
and the union wreath is not of the standard pattern.
The King’s colours in each case follow the usual type.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The Royal Militia of Guernsey</b> possesses an artillery
unit and two battalions of light infantry. Each of
these latter has a blue regimental colour, bearing the
three lions of England, with a sprig above, for the central
badge and a laurel instead of the union wreath. There
is no union flag on the regimental colour but the King’s
colour reveals it according to rule. (Fig. 46).</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Royal Military College, Sandhurst.</b>—This school
possesses a King’s colour of the usual infantry type
and a blue colour of the regimental type. The central
badge of both is the Royal Cypher. The latter reveals
it surrounded by the union wreath and surmounted
by the imperial crown. The Motto “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vires acquirit

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>BATTLE HONOURS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Battle honours, or honorary distinctions as they are
officially termed, form so important a part of the embellishments
of regimental colours that it is necessary
before concluding to give some short account of them.
The reader must not expect in the following pages
to find a complete history of every event, for such
would fill many volumes; all that is aimed at is to give
a few salient facts, such as will recall to mind the stirring
deeds for which the battle honours stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>In previous chapters we have given the honours
accorded to each regiment, but it may be well to point
out that some regiments possess honours which do not
figure on their colours. Also, we may add, some battalions
fly colours with honours not really won by them.
This happens where two regiments have been amalgamated.
In such cases, the unit which becomes the
second battalion gives its distinctions to the first battalion
and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>. It is thus clear that regiments which
are composed of two old regiments may have their
honour rolls considerably lengthened by the process of
amalgamation. For this reason, it is not always a fair
test to judge the glory of a regiment by the number of
distinctions which it owns. On this and other accounts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>we have carefully refrained from giving a list of the
various Army units ranged in order as indicated by
their honours. All that we shall say on this matter is
that the King’s Royal Rifle Corps, were we to compile
such a list, would take first place and, unfortunately,
it has no colours on which to display its fine prowess.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Abu Klea.</b>—Battle fought on January 17th, 1885, by a small
British army during the unsuccessful endeavour to reach Gordon
in Khartoum. Colonel Burnaby was killed and the British
square broken but reformed and the Mahdi’s tribesmen were
beaten off.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Abyssinia.</b>—This expedition was directed against Theodore,
the Negus of Abyssinia, who seized the British subjects resident
in his territory, because the English had refused to share in his
quarrels with the Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Aden.</b>—Captured from the Arabians in 1839 by the British.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Affghanistan, 1839.</b>—An expedition to place the ex-king
Shah-Soojah, on the Afghan throne; led by Sir John Keane.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Afghanistan, 1878–80.</b>—To avenge the murder of Sir L.
Cavagnari, and to secure the passes overlooking the valley
of the Punjab from being perpetually harassed, Lord Roberts,
V.C., advanced on Cabul and fought a number of successful
engagements.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Ahmad Khel.</b>—During Sir D. Stewart’s march from Kandahar
to Ghuznee and then on to join Lord Roberts, he encountered
a force of Ghazis at Ahmad Khel and secured a victory over
them.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Albuhera.</b>—Probably the hardest fought battle of the Peninsular
War. Marshal Beresford attempted to prevent Soult from
advancing to the relief of besieged Badajoz. The Middlesex
Regiment here earned its name of the “Diehards” and a desperate
charge of the Royal Fusiliers turned the day, and “fifteen
hundred unwounded men, the remnant of six thousand unconquerable
British soldiers, stood triumphant on the fatal field.”
(Napier).</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span><b>Ali Masjid.</b>—A fort attacked by a column under General Sir
S. Browne, at the opening of the Afghan War, 1878.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Aliwal.</b>—One of the battles of the first Sikh War.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Ally Ghur.</b>—The first engagement in the Mahratta War.
(September 4th, 1803).</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Alma.</b>—The first battle of the Crimean War. Here the
British and French landed and successfully stormed the heights.
R. Gibb’s famous picture, “Forward 42nd,” refers to this
battle.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Almaraz.</b>—A defeat for the English in Spain by Louis XIV.
during the War of the Spanish Succession.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Amboyna.</b>—An island in the Moluccas, where disputes with the
native and English traders has led to a series of unfortunate
differences with Holland, to whom it belongs.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Arcot.</b>—A fort in the Carnatic held by Clive. By making
it a stronghold he was able to draw Dupleix from the hard pressed
garrison in Trinchinopoly, and thus relieve, in a measure, its
vicissitudes.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Arroyo dos Molinos.</b>—One of the lesser engagements in the
Peninsular War, in which the Border Regiment outflanked a
French regiment and took prisoners the men of a whole
battalion.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Ashantee, 1873–4.</b>—The Dutch gave to the British all their
rights in this country in exchange for territory in Sumatra.
The native king raised certain objections and also treated British
missionaries in a cruel manner. Human sacrifices were among
his abominable practices. When the British Government
demanded that he should rule decently, he declared war.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Atbara.</b>—A prelude to the Battle of Omdurman, fought against
the Dervishes on Good Friday, 1898.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Ava.</b>—Near this town the last fighting in the first Burmese
War took place. (February, 1826).</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Badajoz.</b>—A strong fortress in Spain taken by us from the
French, by assault, during the Peninsular War, 1812.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Badara.</b>—A British victory which terminated Dutch influence
in India.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span><b>Balaklava.</b>—(October 26th, 1854). A battle in the Crimean
War resulting from Mentschikoff’s attempt to get to the coast
and so cut off the British from their base. Noted for the stand
of the “thin red line,” i.e., 93rd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,
and the desperate charges of the “Heavy and Light”
Brigades of Cavalry.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Banda.</b>—Islands in the Malay Archipelago which have been
twice taken from the Dutch and twice restored to them.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Barrosa.</b>—(March 5th, 1811). A battle in the Peninsular
War in which we suffered serious losses owing to the incapacity
of the Spanish general, La Peña. His army looked on while
4,000 British defeated 9,000 French.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Beaumont.</b>—Battle fought near Cambrai and Le Cateau,
during the campaign of 1794. A dense fog enabled our troops
to surprise the French with a resulting gain for us.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Bhurtpore.</b>—A very powerful fortress in Rajputana. General
Lake had failed to capture it in 1805 and it was considered by
the Indians to be impregnable. The British had guaranteed
the throne to the rightful heir, but his uncle usurped it, and
war followed. It was brilliantly taken by assault in 1826 and
its capture did much to establish our reputation in India.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Bladensburg.</b>—An action in the great American War which
took place on August 24th, 1814.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Blenheim.</b>—(August 13th, 1704). One of the greatest of
Britain’s victories; fought by Marlborough to prevent the
capture of Vienna by the Marshals of the French King, Louis
XIV., and the Bavarians.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Bourbon.</b>—A French island, near Mauritius, taken by the
British during the Peninsular War in order that our shipping
might be protected from enemy raiding vessels which issued
from the island harbours.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Royal Canadian Regiment is the only regular unit in the
Canadian Forces. It was first raised in December, 1883, for the purpose
of instructing the Canadian Militia, and was called the Infantry School
Corps. Since then it has been known as the Royal Regiment of Canadian
Infantry, then the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry, and later by
its present title. In 1894 H.M. Queen Victoria gave her Imperial Cypher
V.R.I. as a badge. The Regiment was increased during the South African
War by the raising of a 2nd and 3rd Battalion; these were afterwards
disbanded. In 1885 the Regiment took part in the suppression of the
North West Rebellion under General Middleton at Batoche and Cut-Knife
Creek. In 1896 it formed part of the Expedition sent up to police the
New Yukon District, where it remained for two years. In 1899–1900, the
2nd Battalion fought in South Africa with the 19th Brigade, doing
particularly good service at Paardeburg. In 1905 the establishment was
increased, when the Imperial Troops handed over the garrisoning of the
fortresses at Halifax and elsewhere to Canadian Troops. In 1914, on the
outbreak of war, the Battalion relieved the 2nd Bn. Lincolnshire Regiment
at Bermuda, where it remained for eleven months. It landed in France
in November, 1915, and took part in the battle of Ypres of June, 1916,
Somme, September, 1916, and Vimy, 1917. It particularly distinguished
itself on the Somme and Vimy. H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught is
Colonel of the Regiment. In 1901, H.R.H. the Duke of Cornwall and
York (now H.M. King George V.) presented Colours to the Regiment at
Toronto. In 1904, H.E. Lord Minto, Governor-General of Canada,
presented at Ottawa a special Banner given by H.M. King Edward VII.
for service in South Africa.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
